EDA.py: This file reads in the labeled data 
from the file (Data_Xiao_fixed.csv)
and performs Exploratory Data Analysis on it. This is the EDA related
to all properties of the labeled data. The results
of this script (all graphs that it generates)
are also present in the "Graphs" directory.
The script does not save the results anywhere, 
it just displays the graphs one by one when the 
script is run.
