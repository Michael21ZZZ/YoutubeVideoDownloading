ways your body tries to tell you that your <MT>liver</MT> is being damaged the <MT>liver</MT> is the largest solid <MT>organ</MT> in your body
it is located in the right upper quadrant of your <MT>abdomen</MT> and partly protected by the <MT>ribs</MT>
you need your <MT>liver</MT> for many important bodily functions and cannot live without your <MT>liver</MT>
for this reason you should know the early signs of <MT>liver damage</MT> and take care of your <MT>liver</MT>
there are more than hundred different kinds of <MT>diseases of the liver</MT>
each has its own set of symptoms
some of these <MT>diseases</MT> include <MT>alcoholic liver</MT> <MT>disease hepatitis fatty</MT> <MT>liver disease</MT> and <MT>cirrhosis of the liver</MT>
the early signs of <MT>liver disease</MT> tend to be easily overlooked and are non specific related to any number of different conditions
here are some common early signs
<MT>upset stomach</MT> you are likely to get <MT>nausea</MT> and <MT>vomiting</MT>
they can mimic other diseases such as <MT>migraines</MT> <MT>food poisoning</MT> <MT>vertigo</MT> <MT>motion sickness</MT> <MT>early pregnancy depression</MT> and <MT>vomiting</MT>
it can mimic <MT>kidney</MT> problems
those who suffer from <MT>early liver damage</MT> often feel persistently <MT>nauseous</MT> because the <MT>liver</MT> has decreased ability to rid the body of <MT>toxins</MT>
the <MT>nausea</MT> can also be due to ongoing <MT>metabolism</MT> and changes in digestion
if you have these symptoms for several days and don know why seek the attention of your doctor
fatigue and overall weakness one of the early and obvious signs of <MT>liver damage</MT> is constantly feeling tired and weak
when the <MT>liver</MT> is not in great condition the body
this is due to an increase in <MT>toxins</MT> in the <MT>bloodstream</MT> that can be cleared out because the <MT>liver</MT> can get rid of the <MT>toxins</MT>
if the symptoms persist especially with other early signs of <MT>liver damage</MT> seek medical advice
<MT>lack of appetite</MT> this happens due to lack of production of <MT>bile</MT> that helps digest <MT>fat</MT> in the diet
when food isn properly digested it can lead to <MT>lack of appetite</MT> and severe <MT>loss of weight</MT>
see your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms
digestion problems the <MT>liver</MT> is important in digestion because it makes <MT>bile</MT> that helps the nutrients be better processed and absorbed by the <MT>small intestines</MT>
if the <MT>liver</MT> is failing you can develop an increase in <MT>indigestion</MT> and <MT>diarrhea</MT>
if the <MT>bile</MT> is not produced properly you can also experience <MT>irritable bowel syndrome</MT> <MT>fatty food intolerance</MT> <MT>alcohol intolerance</MT> <MT>abdominal bloating constipation</MT> and <MT>gallstones</MT>
if this becomes severe you need to seek the medical attention of doctor
alterations in the color of <MT>urine</MT> if you think you are drinking enough but still have dark color of your <MT>urine</MT> this may be one of the early signs of <MT>liver damage</MT>
the <MT>urine</MT> may look brown amber or orange in color because of elevated <MT>levels of bilirubin</MT> in the <MT>bloodstream</MT>
the <MT>bilirubin</MT> is elevated because the <MT>liver</MT> cannot get rid of the <MT>bilirubin</MT> and it is excreted through the <MT>kidneys</MT>
<MT>dark urine</MT> may also be due to <MT>dehydration</MT> side effects of taking <MT>antibiotics</MT> taking <MT>vitamin supplements</MT> <MT>urinary tract infections</MT> <MT>enzyme deficiencies</MT> or <MT>kidney abnormalities</MT>
the doctor can help sort out the cause of <MT>dark urine</MT>
changes in <MT>stool</MT> coloration because the <MT>bile</MT> is not made enough by <MT>malfunctioning liver</MT>
instead of being brown it can become pale yellow clay colored or gray in appearance
if this happens periodically it is not dangerous but if it happens often seek the advice of your doctor to check out your <MT>liver</MT>
<MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is probably the most serious medical condition
so what is <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> why is it so serious and why haven you heard
here is what you need to know
the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is cluster of the most dangerous <MT>heart attack</MT> risk factors <MT>raised blood glucose central adiposity</MT> often called beer belly abnormal <MT>cholesterol levels</MT> abnormal <MT>blood fats</MT> also called <MT>triglycerides</MT> and <MT>high blood pressure</MT>
it is estimated that in adults have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and the condition becomes more common as we get older so that by the age of nearly third of adults have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
so why is <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
well if you have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> you are much more likely to suffer <MT>heart attack</MT> or stroke more likely to develop full blown <MT>diabetes</MT> more likely to develop cancer and more likely to develop <MT>alzheimer disease</MT>
all of these conditions
<MT>dementia</MT> and <MT>alzheimer disease</MT> have overtaken cancer and <MT>heart disease</MT> as the leading cause of death in england and wales in and the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and <MT>diabetes</MT>
so how can you check to see if you have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
well first of all get out tape measure
if you are man and your waist circumference is more than cm or if you are woman and your waist is more than cm you have one of the main features of <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
if in addition you have any of the following you will be classified as having <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> <MT>raised blood triglycerides</MT> <MT>reduced hdl cholesterol</MT> sometimes known as good <MT>cholesterol</MT> <MT>raised blood pressure</MT> or <MT>raised fasting plasma glucose</MT>
note if you are man of south asian or indian heritage the important threshold for waist circumference is cm
<MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> has not yet been classified as <MT>disease</MT> it is still regarded as collection of signs and symptoms which together are serious risk factors for our most deadly and disabling medical conditions
several medical organisations such as the world health organisation who the independent <MT>diabetes</MT> federation idf and the european group for the study of <MT>insulin resistance</MT> egir define the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> in very slightly different ways and this adds even more to the confusion about what exactly <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
however many experts now believe that the underlying problem in <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
<MT>insulin resistance</MT> develops when this <MT>hormone</MT> cannot work properly when <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> are abnormally high and still relatively ineffective in keeping <MT>blood glucose levels</MT>
metabolic specialists now use the term <MT>insulin resistance syndrome</MT> instead of <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
<MT>insulin</MT> is <MT>hormone</MT> produced by the <MT>pancreas</MT> and it is important in the <MT>metabolism</MT> of <MT>carbohydrates</MT> and <MT>fats</MT>
when sugar and <MT>carbohydrates</MT> are eaten <MT>insulin</MT> promotes the uptake of <MT>glucose</MT> from the <MT>blood</MT> into <MT>muscles</MT> and <MT>fat cells</MT>
hence it is often said that <MT>insulin</MT> allows cells to use <MT>glucose</MT> for energy and also to store excess <MT>glucose</MT> and sugar as <MT>glycogen</MT> and <MT>fat</MT>
when <MT>blood glucose levels</MT> fall stored <MT>glucose</MT> is released for energy from the breakdown of <MT>glycogen</MT> stores in the <MT>liver</MT> and in the <MT>muscles</MT>
in the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> <MT>insulin levels</MT>
fasting <MT>blood levels of insulin</MT> in the morning are often abnormally high and <MT>insulin levels</MT> rise to very high levels when food is eaten
continuously high <MT>levels of insulin</MT> cause the <MT>liver cells</MT> to store <MT>fat</MT> resulting in <MT>fatty liver</MT>
as the <MT>insulin resistance</MT> worsens the <MT>pancreas</MT> may not be able to produce enough <MT>insulin</MT> in response to food and then <MT>glucose levels in the blood</MT> rise above the threshold for the patient to be called <MT>diabetic</MT>
so why haven you heard of <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
well until quite recently the connection between <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and host of <MT>chronic diseases</MT>
we now know that <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
until recently it was difficult to measure <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> but the technology has improved and we can now measure <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> accurately and we have good tests to diagnose <MT>insulin resistance</MT> as well as good strategies to reverse <MT>insulin resistance</MT> and the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
once you can measure <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
also get our <MT>diabetes</MT> management guide here this is great question because sometimes the term <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> also called <MT>syndrome</MT> is used when discussing <MT>pre diabetes</MT>
but the are not the same thing
according to the mayo clinic <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is cluster of conditions <MT>increased blood pressure</MT> <MT>high blood sugar</MT> excess <MT>body fat</MT> around the waist and <MT>abnormal cholesterol</MT> or <MT>triglyceride levels</MT> that occur together increasing your risk of <MT>heart disease</MT> stroke and <MT>diabetes</MT>
having just one of these conditions doesn mean you have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
however any of these conditions increase your risk of serious <MT>disease</MT>
having more than one of these might increase your risk even more
an underlying cause of <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is <MT>insulin resistance</MT> condition that increases the chances of developing <MT>pre diabetes</MT> type <MT>diabetes</MT> and <MT>cardiovascular disease</MT>
so an understanding of the interaction of <MT>insulin resistance</MT> <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and <MT>pre diabetes</MT> is critical to making lifestyle changes that can help you avoid type <MT>diabetes</MT>
food is broken down in the body into <MT>glucose</MT> the <MT>simple sugar</MT>
it is digested into many different <MT>macromolecules protein fat</MT> and <MT>carbohydrates</MT>
then <MT>carbohydrates</MT> are broken down further into <MT>glucose</MT> which is the simple energy used by cells
<MT>insulin</MT> allows this <MT>glucose</MT> to leave the <MT>blood stream</MT> and enter the cell where it can fuel the activities of that cell
your <MT>pancreas</MT> makes and secretes <MT>insulin</MT>
but <MT>glucose</MT> can enter the cells if your <MT>pancreas</MT> doesn manufacture enough <MT>insulin</MT> or your cells are unable to process the <MT>insulin</MT> that is present in the <MT>blood stream</MT>
as result <MT>glucose levels</MT> become elevated setting the stage for <MT>pre diabetes</MT>
<MT>tissues</MT> with too much <MT>fat</MT> produce fewer <MT>insulin receptors</MT> and are more resistant to <MT>insulin</MT>
in vicious cycle the <MT>pancreas</MT> responds by pumping more <MT>insulin</MT> until the <MT>insulin producing cells</MT> die from exhaustion
type <MT>diabetes</MT>
when you are <MT>insulin resistant</MT> your <MT>muscle fat</MT> and <MT>liver cells</MT> do not use <MT>insulin</MT>
the <MT>pancreas</MT> tries to keep up with the demand for <MT>insulin</MT>
eventually the <MT>pancreas</MT> cannot keep up with the body need for <MT>insulin</MT> causing excess <MT>glucose</MT> to build up in the <MT> blood stream</MT>
many people with <MT>insulin resistance</MT> have high levels of both <MT>blood glucose</MT> and <MT>insulin</MT>
<MT>pre diabetes</MT> means you have higher risk of developing type <MT>diabetes</MT>
studies have shown that most people with <MT>pre diabetes</MT> go on to develop <MT>type ii diabetes</MT> within years unless they make changes to their weight their diet and their levels of physical activity
while both <MT>diabetes</MT> <MT>pre diabetes</MT> and <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> have <MT>insulin resistance</MT>

link to the study <MT>acetyl carnitine</MT> to the <MT>brain</MT> <MT>carnitine</MT> acts as reservoir of <MT>long chain fatty acids</MT> for incorporation into <MT>red blood cell membrane phospholipids</MT> during repair after oxidative insults it is also used in the synthesis of <MT>dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine</MT> the major component of <MT>surfactant</MT> in <MT>lung</MT>
<MT>carnitine</MT> can be used therapeutically to stimulate <MT>gastric</MT> and <MT>pancreatic secretions</MT> and in the treatment of <MT>hyperlipoproteinemias</MT>
these nutrients are all required for <MT>carnitine</MT> synthesis <MT>magnesium vitamin iron vitamins</MT> and and <MT>alpha ketoglutarate</MT> along with the cofactors responsible for creating same <MT>methionine</MT> <MT>folic acid vitamin</MT> and <MT>betaine</MT> <MT>carnitine</MT> supplementation has improved some patients who have <MT>angina</MT> secondary to <MT>coronary artery disease</MT>
<MT>carnitine</MT> supplements may be useful in many forms of <MT>toxic</MT> or <MT>metabolic liver disease</MT> and in cases of <MT>heart muscle disease</MT>
hearts undergoing severe <MT>arrhythmia</MT> quickly deplete their stores of <MT>carnitine</MT>
athletes particularly in europe have used <MT>carnitine</MT>
<MT>carnitine</MT> may improve <MT>muscle building</MT> by improving <MT>fat</MT> utilization and may even be useful in treating <MT>obesity</MT>
<MT>carnitine</MT> may be of value in treating pregnant women <MT>hypothyroid</MT> individuals and <MT>male infertility</MT>
even the physician desk reference gives indication for <MT>carnitine</MT> supplements as improving the tolerance of <MT>ischemic heart disease</MT> <MT>myocardial</MT> insufficiencies and <MT>type iv hyperlipoproteinemia</MT>
<MT>carnitine deficiency</MT> is noted in abnormal <MT>liver</MT> function <MT>renal dialysis</MT> patients and severe to moderate <MT>muscular weakness</MT> with associated <MT>anorexia</MT> patients with <MT>chronic fatigue syndrome</MT> <MT>cfs</MT> were found to have low free <MT>carnitine</MT> total <MT>carnitine</MT> and <MT>acylcarnitine</MT> compared to controls <MT>carnitine</MT> is <MT>peripheral antagonist of thyroid</MT>
it inhibits <MT>thyroid hormone</MT>
in <MT>controlled clinical trial carnitine</MT> was shown to reverse or prevent some <MT>symptoms of hyperthyroidism</MT>
conditions associated with <MT>carnitine deficiency</MT> include cancer <MT>diabetes</MT> <MT>alzheimer disease</MT> and <MT>heart failure</MT>
deficienies may result in accumulation of <MT>fat</MT> within <MT>skeletal muscle</MT> <MT>cardiac muscle</MT> and <MT>liver</MT> disruption of <MT>muscle fibers</MT> and an accumulation of large aggregates of <MT>mitochondria</MT> within <MT>skeletal</MT>
deficiency can result in <MT>cardiomyopathy</MT> congestive  <MT>heart failure</MT> <MT>encephalopathy hepatomegaly</MT> impaired growth and development in infants and <MT>neuromuscular disorders</MT>
primary <MT>carnitine deficiency</MT> has symptoms such as <MT>muscle fatigue cramps</MT> and <MT>myoglobinemia</MT> following exercise
additional <MT>symptoms of chronic carnitine</MT> deficiency can include <MT>hypoglycemia</MT> progressive <MT>myasthenia hypotonia</MT> or <MT>lethargy</MT>
<MT>secondary carnitine deficiency</MT> is not as rare and is most commonly associated with dialysis in chronic <MT>renal failure</MT> although it can also be induced by <MT>intestinal resection</MT> severe infection and <MT>liver disease</MT>
first study to reveal mechanism underlying abnormal <MT>fat</MT> accumulation in <MT>hiv</MT> patients boston building upon their earlier research on the <MT>biology of fat metabolism</MT> joslin scientists discovered that <MT>micrornas</MT> which are involved in the formation of mature <MT>rna</MT> and play important roles in many <MT>types of tissue</MT> play major role in the distribution and <MT>determination</MT> of <MT>fat cells</MT> and whole body <MT>metabolism</MT>
also the study is the first to reveal that <MT>micrornas mirnas</MT> influence the development of <MT>lipodystrophy</MT> abnormal <MT>fat</MT> accumulation which affects people with <MT>hiv</MT>

other indications for its deficiency include inactive reflexes <MT>abnormal heartbeat</MT> <MT>heart palpitations anemia</MT> and <MT>severe headaches</MT>
<MT>potassium</MT> deficient people may also experience <MT>high blood pressure</MT> pain in their <MT>intestines <MT>swelling</MT></MT> in their <MT>glands</MT> and <MT>diabetes</MT>
important sources of <MT>potassium</MT>
also you can get an ample amount of this mineral
apart from those nuts lime beans potatoes and poultry are other products to be included in the <MT>potassium</MT>
however the important sources of this mineral also include avocados bananas and coconut water
stabilizes <MT>blood sugar</MT> decrease in the <MT>potassium</MT> level causes drop in <MT>blood sugar</MT>
decrease in <MT>blood sugar</MT> can cause sweating <MT>headache</MT> weakness trembling and nervousness
intake of <MT>potassium</MT> <MT>chloride</MT> and <MT>sodium</MT>
this is also why diabetics are encouraged to keep their <MT>potassium</MT> levels normal to reduce the chances of unpredictable spikes and plunges in their <MT>glucose</MT> and <MT>insulin levels</MT> by stabilizing the <MT>blood sugar</MT> levels
reduces <MT>muscle disorders</MT> sufficient concentration of this mineral is required for the regular contraction
most of the <MT>potassium ions</MT> in the human body are located in the <MT>muscle cells</MT>
it maintains optimal <MT>muscle</MT> and <MT>nerve function</MT> and helps to keep our reflexes fast because it stimulates the neural connectivity of <MT>muscles</MT> and the <MT>brain</MT>
prevents cramps <MT>muscle cramps</MT> are common result of low levels of <MT>potassium</MT> in the <MT>blood condition</MT> called <MT>hypokalemia</MT>
if you consume banana every day you can easily prevent <MT>muscle cramps</MT> because bananas have rich <MT>potassium</MT>
stabilizes <MT>blood pressure</MT> <MT>potassium</MT> is helpful in reversing the role of <MT>sodium</MT>
thus it acts as vital component that maintains the normality of <MT>blood pressure</MT> in the human body
this further reduces the risk of <MT>heart diseases</MT> and <MT>ypertension</MT>
<MT>regulation of blood pressure</MT> is one of the most important functions of this powerful mineral
as mentioned earlier it has <MT>vasodilation</MT> properties that work to relieve the <MT>tension of blood vessels</MT> which is one of the main causes of <MT>high blood pressure</MT>
strengthens <MT>muscles</MT> one of the useful benefits of MT>potassium</MT> is its role in ensuring the proper growth of <MT>muscle tissues</MT> and the utilization of energy released during <MT>metabolism</MT>
the <MT>muscle</MT> including those all important <MT>cardiac muscles</MT> are prone to paralysis due to <MT>deficiency of potassium in person diet</MT>
stimulating cell growth and providing the metabolic energy to do so is vital function of <MT>potassium</MT>
also without the contraction and relaxation that <MT>potassium</MT> allows <MT>muscles</MT> to perform exercise
boosts <MT>metabolism</MT> <MT>potassium</MT> assists in the metabolic processing of various nutrients like <MT>fats</MT> and <MT>carbohydrates</MT>
thus it is of great value in extracting the energy from nutrients that are consumed
studies have shown that this mineral is also an integral part in the synthesis of protein which has an impact on <MT>tissue regeneration cell</MT> growth and an overall balanced <MT>metabolism</MT>
boosts <MT>heart</MT> health the health benefits of <MT>potassium</MT> ensure good health for the heart as well as the <MT>kidneys</MT>
it plays an irreplaceable role in regulating the functions of the <MT>metabolism</MT> and keeping the <MT>heart</MT> and <MT>kidney</MT>
additionally this mineral assists the <MT>kidney</MT> in removing waste through the <MT>process of excretion</MT>
however it is strongly advised to consult your doctor to get recommendations about <MT>potassium</MT> dosage because it can help to stimulate the body to absorb more <MT>calcium</MT> than necessary which can actually calcify and cause <MT>kidney</MT> problems

getting <MT>ketones</MT> into our nutrition the average american will never see starvation or famine the conditions that historically triggered the endogenous production of <MT>ketones</MT>
indeed more people will die worldwide this year of <MT>obesity</MT> related diseases than from hunger
virtually no citizen will experience the consecutive days of starvation or undergo the multi day fast required to trigger their <MT>ketone</MT>
until recently short of starvation the only other recognized way of including <MT>ketones</MT> in the diet was to induce the body to make them endogenously through <MT>low carbohydrate ketogenic type diet</MT> that forces <MT>glucose</MT> and <MT>insulin</MT> levels down thereby inducing the body to burn <MT>fatty acids</MT> to make <MT>ketones</MT>
this approach requires strict dietary compliance making its widespread adoption impossible given the present american diet

descriptions of <MT>thyroid</MT> pain symptoms about percent of the united states population suffers
the risk for developing <MT>hypothyroidism</MT> and <MT>infertility</MT>
if you have multiple signs and symptoms of this problem ask your doctor to check your <MT>thyroid</MT> <MT>hormone</MT> levels and get <MT>treatment of thyroid</MT>
here are the signs and symptoms that you have an <MT>underactive thyroid</MT>
unexplained weight gain weight gain without any change in diet or physical activity may indicate low levels of <MT>thyroid hormones</MT>
these <MT>hormones</MT> help regulate <MT>basal metabolism</MT> and <MT>thermogenesis</MT> as well as the <MT>metabolism of fats</MT> and <MT>glucose</MT>
an <MT>underactive thyroid</MT> contributes to lower <MT>metabolic rate</MT>
if you have unexplained weight gain it is essential to consult your doctor to determine the exact cause and get <MT>hypothyroidism</MT>
dry and flaky skin if you are following your usual beauty and skin care regimen and haven changed any of the products you use but your skin is dry and itchy it could be symptom of <MT>hypothyroidism</MT> or <MT>thyroid dry skin</MT>
the change in <MT>skin texture</MT> and appearance can be due to reduced <MT>blood circulation</MT> one of the side effects of having low <MT>thyroid hormones</MT>
in addition slowed <MT>metabolism</MT> due to low <MT>thyroid hormone</MT> production can reduce sweating
without proper sweating the skin becomes dry and flaky
as these skin
it is best to consult your doctor to see if there is an underlying health condition causing these skin changes
<MT>muscle</MT> soreness and pain people suffering from <MT>hypothyroidism</MT> often experience <MT>muscle weakness pain</MT> stiffness or cramping
there may also be <MT>general joint pain</MT>
low <MT>metabolism</MT> disrupts how your body burns energy which can affect how your <MT>muscles</MT>
low <MT>thyroid</MT> often increases <MT>inflammation</MT> that may be contributing to your <MT>muscle</MT> and <MT>joint pain</MT>
in fact about percent of the <MT>hypothyroid</MT> patients had predominantly sensory signs of <MT>sensorimotor axonal neuropathy</MT> early in the <MT>course of thyroid disease</MT>
<MT>hair losshypothyroidism</MT> hair loss and proper functioning of the <MT>thyroid gland</MT> is essential for the development and maintenance of the <MT>hair follicles</MT> and an <MT>underactive thyroid</MT>
it may also affect eyebrows and body hair
the <MT>thyroid hormones thyroxine</MT> and <MT>triiodothyronine</MT> modulate several aspects of hair <MT>anatomy</MT> from the <MT>hair growth cycle</MT> to the hair <MT>pigmentation</MT>
if you are worried about hair loss and other hair related issues see your doctor to get your <MT>thyroid</MT>
constant fatigue and tiredness fatigue and extreme tiredness are very common in people who have an <MT>underactive thyroid</MT>
when low <MT>thyroid hormones</MT> flow through the <MT>blood cells</MT> do not function properly leading to less energy fatigue and constant tiredness
these symptoms persist even after getting proper sleep
study published in the european journal of endocrinology notes that <MT>autoimmune hypothyroidism</MT>
<MT>menstrual</MT> and <MT>fertility problems</MT> women with <MT>hypothyroidism</MT> may experience <MT>menstrual</MT>
<MT>thyroid hormones</MT> have great influence on <MT>menstruation thyroid pregnancy lactation</MT> and even <MT>uterine involution</MT> after childbirth
in fact the study puts emphasis on the assessment of <MT>thyroid function</MT> in all patients with <MT>menstrual disorders</MT> to avoid unnecessary interventions like <MT>curettage</MT> and <MT>hysterectomy</MT>
<MT>infertility</MT> can also be due to undiagnosed <MT>thyroidconditions</MT>
for any change in <MT>menstrual</MT> pattern as well as problems becoming pregnant it is important to get your <MT>thyroid</MT>

burn <MT>carbohydrates</MT> with <MT>antioxidants alpha lipoic acid thomas delauer</MT> did you know that the body is capable of producing its own antioxidants
one powerful antioxidant produced by the body is <MT>alpha lipoic acid</MT>
<MT>alpha lipoic acid </MT>is found in every cell of the human
both water soluble and <MT>fat</MT> soluble so able to act throughout the body
antioxidants attack <MT>free radicals</MT> which are waste products that occur when the body creates energy through the food we eat
<MT>free radicals</MT> can also come from exposure to toxins and pollutants
negative effects of <MT>free radicals</MT> include slows <MT>metabolism</MT> abnormal cell growth and <MT>proliferation</MT>
<MT>free radicals</MT> lead to cellular damage including damage to <MT>organs</MT>

<MT>ala for fat</MT> loss and building <MT>muscle</MT> multiple studies have found <MT>ala</MT>
one study followed <MT>obese</MT> <MT>diabetic patients</MT> for weeks with either <MT>mg supplementation of ala</MT> per day or <MT>placebo</MT> and found significant effect on body mass index and <MT>triglyceride levels</MT> decreasing <MT>bmi and triglyceride levels</MT> in the subjects with oral <MT>ala</MT> supplementation
protection against <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
<MT>insulin resistance</MT> leads to decreased <MT>glucose</MT> uptake in <MT>fat</MT> and <MT>muscle cells</MT>
<MT>ala</MT> helps to turn <MT>glucose</MT> into energy or fuel for your body through <MT>insulin</MT> signaling when <MT>insulin</MT> binds to the <MT>insulin receptor</MT> cascade of events is started leading to increased <MT>cellular glucose uptake</MT>
<MT>ala</MT> has been shown to activate this cascade of events leading to increased <MT>glucose uptake</MT> in <MT>fat</MT> and <MT>muscle cells</MT>
this is done not through an effect on <MT>insulin levels</MT> but by triggering the same sequence of events leading to <MT>glucose transport</MT> for energy creation
<MT>ala</MT> sort of mimics <MT>insulin</MT>
studies have shown that this shuttling allows more <MT>glucose</MT> to enter <MT>skeletal muscle cells</MT> thus more <MT>glucose</MT> burned as for energy more energy to tear and rebuild <MT>muscles</MT> and less shuttled to be stored as <MT>fat</MT>
when more <MT>glucose</MT> is delivered to <MT>muscle cells</MT> there is less available to be stored as <MT>fat</MT>
so you have more fuel to push <MT>muscle</MT> growth and less <MT>glucose</MT> stored in <MT>fat cells muscle</MT> growth and less <MT>fat</MT>

lose weight without <MT>hcg</MT> instead use asap
<MT>hcg</MT> is fast weight loss for sure but you must go to the doctor to get <MT>injections of the hcg hormone</MT>
asap is not <MT>hcg</MT> but <MT>protein fragments</MT> and <MT>amino acids</MT> as well as <MT>tribulus terrestris extract</MT>
asap contains only certified grade raw materials and is made in the usa
asap also helps you lose weight fast by focusing on losing abnormal <MT>fat</MT> without <MT>hormones</MT> asap allows you to <MT>burn abnormal fat</MT> stores as fuel and helps reset your <MT>metabolism</MT>
if you are on <MT>low calorie diet</MT> you burn structural and normal <MT>fat</MT> stores in your body
asap focuses on <MT>burning abnormal fat</MT> while you follow low <MT>fat</MT> low <MT>carbohydrate diet</MT> for to weeks this will reset your <MT>hypothalamus</MT> so your body can burn <MT>fat</MT>
what is asap
asap contains protein fractions and <MT>amino acids</MT> that allow your body to release the abnormal <MT>fat</MT>
asap contains only certified grade raw materials processed according to good manufacturing practices and is made in the usa
asap program for success every human body has different types of <MT>fat</MT> structural <MT>visceral fat</MT> in and around <MT>muscles</MT> cushioning <MT>organs</MT> padding of bottoms of feet
normal <MT>dermal fat</MT> is directly under the skins surface and provides the soft cushioning between the skin and frame of the body
abnormal <MT>adipose fat</MT> is under the <MT>dermal fat</MT> and not available for use by the <MT>metabolism</MT> until the other kinds of <MT>fat</MT>
<MT>abnormal fat</MT> can be viewed as <MT>famine fat</MT>
it is stored by the body for emergency
yo yo dieting contributes to the storage of this type of <MT>fat</MT> because the body
when calories are restricted the body stores all the <MT>fat</MT>
most typical reduced <MT>calorie diets</MT> will not produce the best results for those individuals with an abundance of abnormal <MT>fat</MT> stores because their bodies will begin by burning the wrong kind of <MT>fat</MT>
when low <MT>calorie diet</MT> is introduced to the system the normal reserves of <MT>fat</MT>
as result most people look gaunt and drawn after reduced <MT>calorie diet</MT>
although the normal reserves of <MT>fat</MT> have been reduced the abnormal <MT>fat</MT>
the asap program supports your body function to burn</MT> the abnormal <MT>adipose fat</MT>

<MT>leptin</MT> and the neural circuit regulation food intake and <MT>glucose metabolism</MT> air date wednesday january pm category wals wednesday afternoon lectures runtime description nih director wednesday afternoon lecture series the discovery of <MT>leptin</MT> has led to the <MT>elucidation</MT> of robust physiologic system that maintains <MT>fat</MT> stores at relatively constant level
<MT>leptin</MT> is <MT>peptide hormone</MT> secreted by <MT>adipose tissue</MT> in proportion to its mass
this <MT>hormone</MT> circulates in <MT>blood</MT> and acts on the <MT>hypothalamus</MT> to regulate food intake and <MT>energy expenditure</MT>
when <MT>fat</MT> mass falls <MT>plasma</MT> <MT>leptin</MT> levels fall stimulating appetite and suppressing <MT>energy expenditure</MT>
when <MT>fat</MT> mass increases <MT>leptin</MT>
by such mechanism total energy stores are stably maintained within relatively narrow range
recessive mutations in the <MT>leptin</MT> gene are associated with massive <MT>obesity</MT>
treatment with recombinant <MT>leptin</MT> markedly reduces food intake
the low <MT>leptin</MT> levels in patients with <MT>leptin</MT> mutations are also associated with multiple abnormalities including <MT>infertility diabetes</MT> and <MT>immune abnormalities</MT> all of which are corrected by <MT>leptin</MT> treatment
these findings have established important links between energy stores and many other <MT>physiologic systems</MT> and led to the use of <MT>leptin</MT> as treatment for an increasing number of other human conditions including subset of <MT>obesity</MT> some forms of <MT>diabetes</MT> including <MT>lipodystrophy</MT> and <MT>hypothalamic amenorrhea</MT> the <MT>cessation of menstruation</MT>
identification of physiologic system that controls energy balance establishes biologic basis for <MT>obesity</MT>
recent studies have explored the relationship between <MT>leptin</MT>
in addition new methods for identifying <MT>neurons</MT> activated by <MT>leptin</MT> and other stimuli have been developed as have methods for <MT>noninvasively activating cells</MT>
these new approaches are being applied to studies

am now able to offer the same <MT>hcg</MT> program
contact our office at castellowellness gmail com
<MT>hcg</MT> stands for <MT>human chorionic gonadotropin</MT>
it is <MT>hormone</MT> released during pregnancy
it rises when you become pregnant and is detectable in the <MT>blood</MT> and <MT>urine</MT> and is the basis
when <MT>hcg</MT> is given to non pregnant people on <MT>very low calorie diet</MT> it helps them to lose more weight and burn greater percentage of <MT>fat</MT>
the body has three types of <MT>fat</MT> structural <MT>fat</MT> reserve <MT>fat</MT> and abnormal <MT>fat</MT> tummy hips
<MT>hcg</MT> helps your body burn
since you are getting calories from your stored <MT>fat</MT>
and you don feel hungry
if you were to only eat calories day without <MT>hcg</MT> you would mainly slow your <MT>metabolism</MT> begin to burn <MT>muscle</MT> and start burning your reserve and structural <MT>fat</MT> not your abnormal <MT>fat</MT>
the <MT>hcg diet</MT> involves taking <MT>hcg</MT> once day preferably as an injection but also available as <MT>sublingual</MT> under the <MT>tongue</MT> drops
you eat very low <MT>calorie diet</MT>
you can have unlimited water
twice day you will eat small meal consisting of ounces of lean protein
you can also spread out the items in each meal
for example fruit for breakfast chicken melba toast and lettuce for lunch fish melba toast and asparagus for dinner and fruit as an after dinner snack
the <MT>hcg</MT> helps to suppress hunger keeps your <MT>metabolism</MT> up and helps to burn abnormal <MT>fat</MT>
you should never do such low calorie diet without medical supervision
the actions and benefits of the <MT>hcg diet</MT>
what can tell you is when patients in my office do the diet with injection
this is substantially more weight loss than would expect with diet
my theory on why <MT>hcg</MT> allows this success is as follows
from cave man perspective if you ate calories day that would signal that there was shortage of food and your body
this triggers slow down in <MT>metabolism</MT> to match food intake and prevent
the exception would be if you were pregnant you wouldn want to slow your <MT>metabolism</MT> and it would be great time to burn your <MT>fat</MT>
that would allow you to not only survive the pregnancy
be careful where you get your <MT>hcg</MT>
the <MT>fda</MT> has cracked down on on line
most online <MT>hcg</MT> comes from the urine of pregnant women in countries like india
injections
pharmaceutical grade <MT>hcg</MT> comes from synthetic origin not pregnant women and is manufactured in the usa by licensed manufacturers and is certified for purity and potency

learn about the best ways to burn <MT>fat</MT>
if you re interested in finding out how to lose belly <MT>fat</MT>
you ll learn about how to lose weight with these exercise and diet
free week challenge most people associate <MT>fat</MT> loss with long grinding
and even though <MT>fat</MT> loss does require work and effort in today video id like to go over the best ways to burn <MT>fat</MT>
when it comes to losing weight and burning <MT>fat</MT> adjusting your diet is gonna be the number one thing you can do to notice the most results so in this video will be going over ways you can burn <MT>fat</MT> faster with both your diet and your workout plan
lets start with the very first method
hirt stands for high intensity resistance training which is little different from hiit which stands for high intensity interval training im sure you guys have heard of hiit but im not so sure you ve heard
both are very similar but while hiit is much more centered around <MT>cardiovascular</MT> movements hirt is essentially strength training for <MT>fat</MT> loss
during hirt workout you ll perform series of strength training
this causes your <MT>heart rate</MT> to stay elevated and your <MT>muscles</MT> will be given very little time to recover
the really awesome thing about this type of workout is that you can build muscle increase endurance and burn
since your break time is gonna be short like to seconds you don
stick to moderate weight load and mix together to five of your weight training exercises back
at the end of that circuit take to second break and then repeat
sample upper body
you would do each of these exercises for <MT>reps</MT> and then repeat this series of exercises
after completing the sets you would want to move on to another series of exercises
the second thing you can do to burn <MT>fat</MT> faster is an aggressive <MT>fat</MT> loss diet
most diet plans
and most people are still under the impression that any diet plan
well can tell you for fact that this is untrue
many people start diet plan and they have lot of weight to lose so they do the traditional cut
now that considering that everything went right over the course of the eight weeks but even in this situation you can see
so demotivator that they might get on the scale
so for people that do have lot of weight to lose highly recommend you go for more aggressive <MT>fat</MT> loss plan
you would set up more aggressive <MT>fat</MT> loss plan
the reason why say set period of time is because forty to percent reduction
you want to have long term diet plan set up so you can transition into that after doing this more aggressive <MT>fat</MT> loss plan
and just note here on this topic you want to be smart about doing an aggressive diet plan
binge eating is more likely to happen when you re really hungry
so when you start feeling hungry or deprived or tired just throw in day of more regular reduction
this will help you reset so you can go back to bigger deficit
the next thing you can do to burn MT>fat</MT> faster is <MT>peripheral heart action training</MT> also known as <MT>pha</MT>
<MT>pha</MT> is kind of similar to hirt and hiit type training because you re going to be doing circuits that involve multiple exercises being done back
however the major difference is that you re going to alternate between upper and lower body movements
now this might not sound like big change but if you try it you ll notice yourself breathingreally heavy as soon as you get to your second exercise
the reason why it works like this is because whenever you work muscle or <MT>group of muscles</MT> your <MT>heart</MT> pumps
<MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is probably the most serious medical condition that you haven heard
so what is <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> why is it so serious and why haven you heard
here is what you need to know
the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is cluster of the most dangerous <MT>heart attack</MT> risk factors <MT>raised blood glucose central adiposity</MT> often called beer belly abnormal <MT>cholesterol levels</MT> abnormal <MT>blood fats</MT> also called <MT>triglycerides</MT> and <MT>high blood pressure</MT>
it is estimated that in adults have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and the condition becomes more common as we get older so that by the age of nearly third of adults have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
so why is <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
well if you have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> you are much more likely to suffer <MT>heart attack</MT> or stroke more likely to develop full blown <MT>diabetes</MT> more likely to develop cancer and more likely to develop <MT>alzheimer disease</MT>
all of these conditions
<MT>dementia</MT> and <MT>alzheimer disease</MT> have overtaken cancer and <MT>heart disease</MT> as the leading cause of death in england and wales in and the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and <MT>diabetes</MT>
so how can you check to see if you have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
well first of all get out tape measure
if you are man and your waist circumference is more than cm or if you are woman and your waist is more than cm you have one of the main features of <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
if in addition you have any of the following you will be classified as having <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> <MT>raised blood triglycerides</MT> <MT>reduced hdl cholesterol</MT> sometimes known as good <MT>cholesterol</MT> <MT>raised blood pressure</MT> or <MT>raised fasting plasma glucose</MT>
note if you are man of south asian or indian heritage the important threshold for waist circumference is cm
<MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> has not yet been classified as <MT>disease</MT> it is still regarded as collection of signs and symptoms which together are serious risk factors for our most deadly and disabling medical conditions
several medical organisations such as the world health organisation who the independent <MT>diabetes</MT> federation idf and the european group for the study of <MT>insulin resistance</MT> egir define the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> in very slightly different ways and this adds even more to the confusion about what exactly <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
however many experts now believe that the underlying problem in <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
<MT>insulin resistance</MT> develops when this <MT>hormone</MT> cannot work properly when <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> are abnormally high and still relatively ineffective in keeping <MT>blood glucose levels</MT>
metabolic specialists now use the term <MT>insulin resistance syndrome</MT>
<MT>insulin</MT> is <MT>hormone</MT> produced by the <MT>pancreas</MT> and it is important in the <MT>metabolism</MT> of <MT>carbohydrates</MT> and <MT>fats</MT>
when sugar and <MT>carbohydrates</MT> are eaten <MT>insulin</MT> promotes the uptake of <MT>glucose</MT> from the <MT>blood</MT> into <MT>muscles</MT> and <MT>fat cells</MT>
hence it is often said that <MT>insulin</MT> allows cells to use <MT>glucose</MT> for energy and also to store excess <MT>glucose</MT> and sugar as <MT>glycogen</MT> and <MT>fat</MT>
when <MT>blood glucose levels</MT> fall stored <MT>glucose</MT> is released for energy from the breakdown of <MT>glycogen</MT> stores in the <MT>liver</MT> and in the <MT>muscles</MT>
in the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
fasting <MT>blood levels of insulin</MT> in the morning are often abnormally high and <MT>insulin levels</MT> rise to very high levels when food is eaten
continuously high <MT>levels of insulin</MT> cause the <MT>liver cells</MT> to store <MT>fat</MT> resulting in <MT>fatty liver</MT> which cannot function
as the <MT>insulin resistance</MT> worsens the <MT>pancreas</MT> may not be able to produce enough <MT>insulin</MT> in response to food and then <MT>glucose levels in the blood</MT>
so why haven you heard
well until quite recently the connection between <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and host of <MT>chronic diseases</MT>
we now know that <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
until recently it was difficult to measure <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> but the technology has improved and we can now measure <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> accurately and we have good tests to diagnose <MT>insulin resistance</MT> as well as good strategies to reverse <MT>insulin resistance</MT> and the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
once you can measure <MT>insulin resistance</MT> you are well on your way to fixing

eating these foods makes you burn <MT>fat</MT>
sometimes the fight gets to be downright discouraging as you count your calories and exercise but you still see the scale
with little bit of information you can actually make the food you eat
knowing which foods help you burn calories or make you feel satisfied so you ll eat less may be all it takes to turn the tide in your favor listed below are foods that can help you burn away the belly bulge simply by eating them muscle building foods proteins are an excellent way to help build and maintain body
they are also harder for the body to break down which means they burn
all nuts are excellent sources of protein
an added benefit to nuts is that they help you feel full faster grass fed
unfortunately beef has gotten bad rap today
dr axe recommends grass fed beef as an excellent source of protein and healthy <MT>fats</MT> which can help build muscle and burn calories in the process
as easy sources of protein
women health shares that they also help build healthybones chicken
besides being great source of protein dr axe shares that chicken has the added benefit of satisfying food cravings causing you to stop eating
according to women health peanut butter is an excellent source of <MT>testosterone</MT> an essential component in maintaining <MT>muscle</MT>
it also helps with burning <MT>fat</MT> as it builds muscle satiating foods eating fruits and vegetables is great but often leaves you hungry
knowing what foods help satisfy hunger or make you feel full faster can help curb your appetite apple cider vinegar
according to dr axe taking one to two tablespoons of vinegar before your meal can help curb your sugar
besides being an excellent source of protein webmd points out that greek yogurt is extra filling keeping you from eating as much food cinnamon
cinnamon has many health benefits but big one is curbing the appetite
webmd recommends putting it in your morning coffee or tea <MT>metabolism</MT> boosting foods speeding up your <MT>metabolism</MT> is great way to burn
some foods will actually speed your <MT>metabolism</MT>
hot and spicy foods are great <MT>metabolism</MT> boosters
any hot pepper will do the job according to webmd and it will add burst of flavor at the same time grapefruit
on the opposite end of the spectrum from hot peppers is grapefruit
according to dr axe it contains <MT>enzymes</MT> that help break down sugar and boost your <MT>metabolism</MT>
no longer do you have to rely on simply counting calories and working out at the gym
you can make your food work for you
by being wise with what you eat
for those unfamiliar <MT>ketogenic dieting</MT> is any diet plan low carb enough to switch your body into state of producing and burning significant amount of <MT>ketones</MT> specifically <MT>acetoacetate acac</MT> and its derivatives <MT>beta hydroxybutyrate</MT> <MT>bhb</MT> and <MT>acetone</MT>
for those interested in background reading ve previously written summary articles about the science of fat <MT>metabolism</MT> and <MT>ketosis</MT>
these <MT>molecules</MT> especially <MT>acac and bhb</MT> are used by the <MT>brain</MT>
while the biological processes involved are extremely complex invite you to use this as the beginning of an important conversation for you and your doctor to explore together
indeed <MT>ketogenic dieting</MT> may or may not be appropriate for you so please consult with your doctor before experimenting on yourself
focusing the <MT>brain</MT> increased memory cognition clarity and seizure control less <MT>migraines ketogenic diets</MT> were notably first used at the mayo clinic in the to treat
while the exact mechanism of seizure prevention on <MT>ketogenic diet</MT> is still mystery researchers believe it has something to do with the increased stability of <MT>neurons</MT> and up regulation of <MT>brain</MT> <MT>mitochondria</MT> and <MT>mitochondrial enzymes</MT>
related to this research some serious attention has been given to <MT>ketogenic dieting</MT> and <MT>alzheimers disease</MT>
scientists have discovered increased cognition and enhanced memory in adults with impairments in these areas and growing body of research shows improvement at all stages of <MT>dementia</MT>
<MT>ketosis</MT> has been shown to be effective against <MT>parkinson disease</MT>
for broader audience of dieters the often reported side effects of increased mental clarity and focus and less frequent and less intense <MT>migraines</MT> are likely related to the more stable <MT>blood sugar</MT> and altered <MT>brain chemistry</MT>
fighting some types of cancer dom agostino lab published an article in entitled <MT>ketone</MT> supplementation decreases <MT>tumor cell</MT> viability and prolongs survival of mice with <MT>metastatic cells</MT> express an abnormal <MT>metabolism</MT> characterized by increased <MT>glucose</MT> consumption
previous studies indicate that unlike healthy <MT>tissues cancer cells</MT> are unable to effectively use <MT>ketone</MT> bodies
furthermore <MT>ketones</MT> inhibit the <MT>proliferation</MT> and viability of <MT>cultured tumor cells</MT>
preventing <MT>heart disease</MT> lower <MT>blood pressure</MT> lower <MT>triglycerides</MT> better <MT>cholesterol</MT> profiles again related to the downstream effects of keeping <MT>blood glucose</MT> low and stable <MT>ketogenic dieting</MT> helps keep <MT>blood pressure</MT> in check and lowers <MT>triglyceride levels</MT>
while it may seem counterintuitive that eating higher percentage of <MT>fat</MT> in your diet <MT>lowers triglycerides</MT> it turns out that the consumption of excess carbs especially <MT>fructose</MT> is the key driver of increasing <MT>triglycerides</MT>
and regarding <MT>hdl</MT> and <MT>ldl particles</MT> which the body uses to move <MT>fat</MT> and <MT>cholesterol</MT> around <MT>ketogenic dieting</MT> helps raise <MT>hdl good cholesterol</MT> and improve the profile of <MT>ldl bad cholesterol</MT>
improving energy levels and sleep by day or on <MT>ketogenic diet</MT> most people report an increase in general energy levels and lack of cravings for carbs
the mechanism here involves both stabilization of <MT>insulin</MT> levels and readily available source of energy for our <MT>brain</MT>
sleep
studies have shown that <MT>ketogenic dieting</MT> improves sleep by decreasing <MT>rem</MT> and increasing slow wave sleep
while the exact mechanism is unclear it likely is related to the complex biochemical shifts involving the <MT>brain</MT> use of <MT>ketones</MT> for energy combined with other body tissues directly burning
an important caveat is that <MT>ketogenic diet</MT> temporarily raises <MT>uric acid</MT> levels especially when <MT>dehydrated</MT> but over time they come down
combined with tons of <MT>anecdotal</MT> evidence over the years there is an entire movement behind bodybuilders using ketogenic approach to gain more muscle and less <MT>fat</MT> typically muscle gain also comes with <MT>fat</MT> gain so there understandable attention being given toward preventing
in addition dr stephen phinney and dr jeff volek have number of papers published about <MT>ketogenic dieting</MT> for ultra
in short once these athletes are fully <MT>fat</MT> adapted there is evidence to suggest that mental and physical performance is significantly improved beyond normal <MT>carbohydrate</MT>
and last but not least curbing diabetes <MT>obesity</MT> and <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>

<MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is probably the most serious medical condition that you haven heard
so what is <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> why is it so serious and why haven you heard
here is what you need to know
the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is cluster of the most dangerous <MT>heart attack</MT> risk factors <MT>raised blood glucose central adiposity</MT> often called beer belly abnormal <MT>cholesterol levels</MT> abnormal <MT>blood fats</MT> also called <MT>triglycerides</MT> and <MT>high blood pressure</MT>
it is estimated that in adults have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and the condition becomes more common as we get older so that by the age of nearly third of adults have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
so why is <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
well if you have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> you are much more likely to suffer <MT>heart attack</MT> or stroke more likely to develop full blown <MT>diabetes</MT> more likely to develop cancer and more likely to develop <MT>alzheimer disease</MT>
all of these conditions
<MT>dementia</MT> and <MT>alzheimer disease</MT> have overtaken cancer and <MT>heart disease</MT> as the leading cause of< death in england and wales in and the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and <MT>diabetes</MT>
so how can you check to see if you have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
well first of all get out tape measure
if you are man and your waist circumference is more than cm or if you are woman and your waist is more than cm you have one of the main features of <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
if in addition you have any of the following you will be classified as having <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> <MT>raised blood triglycerides</MT> <MT>reduced hdl cholesterol</MT> sometimes known as good <MT>cholesterol</MT> <MT>raised blood pressure</MT> or <MT>raised fasting plasma glucose</MT>
note if you are man of south asian or indian heritage the important threshold for waist circumference is cm
<MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> has not yet been classified as <MT>disease</MT> it is still regarded as collection of signs and symptoms which together are serious risk factors for our most deadly and disabling medical conditions
several medical organisations such as the world health organisation who the independent <MT>diabetes</MT> federation idf and the european group for the study of <MT>insulin resistance</MT> egir define the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> in very slightly different ways and this adds even more to the confusion about what exactly <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
however many experts now believe that the underlying problem in <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
<MT>insulin resistance</MT> develops when this <MT>hormone</MT> cannot work properly when <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> are abnormally high and still relatively ineffective in keeping <MT>blood glucose levels</MT>
metabolic specialists now use the term <MT>insulin resistance syndrome</MT>
<MT>insulin</MT> is <MT>hormone</MT> produced by the <MT>pancreas</MT> and it is important in the <MT>metabolism</MT> of <MT>carbohydrates</MT> and <MT>fats</MT>
when sugar and <MT>carbohydrates</MT> are eaten <MT>insulin</MT> promotes the uptake of <MT>glucose</MT> from the <MT>blood</MT> into <MT>muscles</MT> and <MT>fat cells</MT>
hence it is often said that <MT>insulin</MT> allows cells to use <MT>glucose</MT> for energy and also to store excess <MT>glucose</MT> and sugar as <MT>glycogen</MT> and <MT>fat</MT>
when <MT>blood glucose levels</MT> fall stored <MT>glucose</MT> is released for energy from the breakdown of <MT>glycogen</MT> stores in the <MT>liver</MT> and in the <MT>muscles</MT>
in the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
fasting <MT>blood levels of insulin</MT> in the morning are often abnormally high and <MT>insulin levels</MT> rise to very high levels when food is eaten
continuously <MT>high levels of insulin</MT> cause the <MT>liver cells</MT> to store <MT>fat</MT> resulting in <MT>fatty liver</MT> which cannot function
as the <MT>insulin resistance</MT> worsens the <MT>pancreas</MT> may not be able to produce enough <MT>insulin</MT> in response to food and then <MT>glucose levels in the blood</MT>

want to lose weight and melt <MT>fat</MT>
unique kit
bt wdpfua the science behind hcgin the dr
simeons
was looking for cure for <MT>obesity</MT>
his research on this subject spanned over years mostly from his lab in italy whereby he found what many call the holy grail of weight loss he founded the research that lead to <MT>hcg</MT> weight loss
dr simeons found that given the right circumstances people could lose as much as pound of pure <MT>fat</MT>
not lean muscle or water weight but <MT>fat</MT>
most people thought it crazy to lose pound per day and still be healthy
it true dr
over the years other doctors began studying dr simeons unique protocol and taking it back
most came to the same conclusion which was that people were not just losing pounds and inches but they were able to keep it off using the <MT>hcg program</MT>
the answer is in understanding how the body
the human body has three kinds of <MT>fat</MT>
the first is the structural <MT>fat</MT> which fills the gaps between various <MT>organs</MT> sort of packing material
structural <MT>fat</MT> also performs important functions as bedding the <MT>kidneys</MT> in <MT>soft elastic tissue</MT> protecting the <MT>coronary arteries</MT> and keeping the skin
it also provides the springy cushion of hard fat under the <MT>bones of the feet</MT>
the second type is called the normal <MT>fat</MT>
the normal <MT>fat</MT> reserve is drawn upon when the nutritional income from the <MT>intestinal tract</MT> is insufficient to meet the demand
such normal reserves are localized all over the body
<MT>fat</MT> is substance which packs the highest caloric value into the smallest space so that normal reserves of fuel for muscular activity and the maintenance of body temperature
both these types of <MT>fat</MT> structural and reserve are normal and even if the body stocks them to capacity this can never be called <MT>obesity</MT>
the third type of <MT>fat</MT> is abnormal <MT>fat</MT>
it is the accumulation of abnormal <MT>fat</MT> that is found in people who are <MT>obese</MT>
this abnormal <MT>fat</MT> is also potential reserve of fuel but unlike the normal reserves it is not available to the body in nutritional emergency
the reason the abnormal <MT>fat</MT>
typical dieters will lose normal <MT>fat</MT> reserves first and then move onto the structural <MT>fat</MT>
by the time people get to the point that they can target the abnormal <MT>fat</MT> they have become too week and too hungry and don quite get there how is  <MT>hcg fat</MT> loss like money if you look at it like money abnormal <MT>fat</MT> is non liquid asset and reserve <MT>fat</MT> is like cash or liquid
your body can use reserve <MT>fat</MT> immediately on demand
but abnormal <MT>fat</MT> sometimes referred to as stubborn <MT>fat</MT> cannot be accessed on demand
there is special process that must occur in order for you to access your abnormal <MT>fat</MT>
much like the process you must go through to access non liquid assets be it the selling of stocks and bonds or even selling
in these latter cases your money is tied up and not immediately accessible
this video presents discussion on ectopic <MT>fat</MT> depots by three experts in this area dr ulf smith from sweden dr marja riitta taskinen from finland and dr
dr smith introduces the notion of ectopic <MT>fat</MT>
dr taskinen explains that the <MT>liver</MT> is very <MT>central organ</MT> because of its importance in the <MT>metabolism</MT> of <MT>triglyceride</MT> rich <MT>lipoproteins</MT>
an imbalance in <MT>lipid metabolism</MT> may cause <MT>fatty liver</MT> and an <MT>atherogenic</MT>
moreover she explains that in addition to <MT>fat</MT> accumulation in the <MT>liver</MT> and in <MT>visceral depots lipids</MT> can also accumulate around the <MT>heart</MT>
dr jensen recalls that some individuals are able to expand their <MT>fat</MT> <MT>depot</MT> and remain healthy while others with the same amount or even less <MT>adipose tissue expansion</MT>
in this case when <MT>adipose tissue</MT> cannot properly store <MT>lipids</MT> the excess energy ends up in the <MT>liver</MT> the <MT>heart</MT> and the <MT>muscle cells</MT>
several mechanisms are proposed by dr

the condition
when this process of <MT>fat metabolism</MT> is disrupted the <MT>fat</MT> can accumulate in the <MT>liver</MT> in excessive amounts thus resulting in <MT>fatty liver</MT>
it is difficult to distinguish alcoholic fld from nonalcoholic fld and both show microvesicular and macrovesicular fatty changes at different stages

what is <MT>diabetic cardiomyopathy</MT>
what does <MT>diabetic cardiomyopathy</MT>
<MT>diabetic cardiomyopathy</MT> meaning <MT>diabetic cardiomyopathy</MT>
source wikipedia org article adapted under <MT>diabetic cardiomyopathy</MT> is <MT>disorder of the heart muscle</MT> in people with <MT>diabetes</MT>
it can lead to inability of the <MT>heart</MT> to circulate <MT>blood</MT> through the body effectively state known as <MT>heart failure</MT> with accumulation of fluid in the <MT>lungs pulmonary edema</MT> or legs
most <MT>heart failure</MT> in people with <MT>diabetes</MT> results from <MT>coronary artery disease</MT> and <MT>diabetic cardiomyopathy</MT> is only said to exist if there is no <MT>coronary artery disease</MT> to explain the <MT>heart muscle disorder</MT>
one particularity of dcm is the long latent phase during which the <MT>disease</MT>
in most cases dcm is detected with concomitant <MT>hypertension</MT> or <MT>coronary artery disease</MT>
one of the earliest signs is mild <MT>left ventricular diastolic dysfunction</MT> with little effect on <MT>ventricular</MT>
also the <MT>diabetic patient</MT> may show subtle signs of dcm related to decreased <MT>left ventricular</MT> compliance or <MT>left ventricular hypertrophy</MT>
prominent wave can also be noted in the jugular venous pulse and the <MT>cardiac</MT>
after the development of <MT>systolic dysfunction left <MT>ventricular dilation</MT></MT> and <MT>symptomatic heart failure</MT>
<MT>systolic mitral murmur</MT> is not uncommon in these cases
these changes are accompanied by variety of electroc ardiographic changes that may be associated with dcm in of patients without <MT>structural heart disease</MT>
later in the progression prolonged qt interval may be indicative of <MT>fibrosis</MT>
given that dcm definition excludes concomitant <MT>atherosclerosis</MT> or <MT>hypertension</MT> there are no changes in perfusion or in <MT>atrial natriuretic peptide</MT> levels up until the very late stages of the disease when the <MT>hypertrophy</MT> and <MT>fibrosis</MT>
defects in cellular processes such as <MT>autophagy</MT> and <MT>mitophagy</MT>  are thought to contribute to the development of <MT>diabetic cardiomyopathy</MT>
<MT>diabetic cardiomyopathy</MT> is characterized functionally by <MT>ventricular dilation</MT> enlargement of <MT>heart cells</MT> prominent interstitial <MT>fibrosis</MT> and decreased or preserved
while it has been evident for long time that the complications seen in <MT>diabetes</MT> are related to the <MT>hyperglycemia</MT> associated to it several factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the <MT>disease</MT>
<MT>etiologically</MT> four main causes are responsible for the development of <MT>heart failure</MT> in dcm <MT>microangiopathy</MT> and related <MT>endothelial dysfunction</MT> autonomic neuropathy metabolic alterations that include abnormal <MT>glucose</MT> use and increased <MT>fatty acid oxidation</MT> generation and accumulation of <MT>free radicals</MT>
<MT>microangiopathy</MT> can be characterized as <MT>subendothelial and endothelial fibrosis</MT> in the <MT>coronary</MT> <MT>microvasculature</MT> of the <MT>heart</MT>
this <MT>endothelial dysfunction</MT> leads to <MT>impaired myocardial blood</MT>
about of diabetics with dcm show pathologic evidence for <MT>microangiopathy</MT> such as <MT>sub endothelial and endothelial fibrosis</MT> compared to only of non diabetic <MT>heart failure</MT>
over the years several hypotheses were postulated to explain the <MT>endothelial dysfunction</MT> observed in <MT>diabetes</MT>
it was hypothesized that the extracellular <MT>hyperglycemia</MT> leads to an intracellular <MT>hyperglycemia</MT> in cells unable to regulate their <MT>glucose</MT> uptake most predominantly <MT>endothelial cells</MT>
indeed while <MT>hepatocytes</MT> and <MT>myocytes</MT> have mechanisms allowing them to internalize their <MT>glucose transporter</MT> <MT>endothelial cells</MT> do not possess
the consequences of increased intracellular <MT>glucose concentration</MT> are fourfold all resulting from increasing concentration of <MT>glycolytic </MT> <MT>intermediates</MT> upstream of the rate limiting <MT>glyceraldehyde phosphate</MT> reaction which is inhibited by mechanisms activated by increased free radical formation common in <MT>diabetes</MT>
four pathways enumerated below all explain part of the <MT>diabetic complications</MT>

presented by mary turyk associate professor of epidemiology school of public health university of illinois at chicago human exposure to <MT>persistent organic</MT> pollutants or pops is ubiquitous and occurs primarily through consumption

this presentation will describe contaminant exposures and fish consumption

while the <MT>biologic pathways</MT> by which environmental exposures may increase <MT>diabetes</MT> risk have not been elucidated evidence will be presented that suggest pops may have stronger impact on <MT>blood glucose</MT> in persons at higher risk for <MT>diabetes</MT>
click here type <MT>diabetes</MT>is <MT>chronic disease</MT> characterized by abnormal <MT>glucose</MT> <MT>metabolism</MT>
type <MT>diabetes</MT> is by far the most common form of <MT>diabetics</MT> actually suffer
in the case of type <MT>diabetes</MT> there is resistance of the <MT>tissues</MT> to <MT>insulin</MT> and decreased response to <MT>glucose</MT> by the <MT>pancreas</MT>
the circulating endogenous <MT>insulin</MT> is sufficient to prevent <MT>ketosis</MT>
there is often excessive <MT>insulin secretion</MT> and excessive activity of the <MT>beta cells</MT> in the <MT>pancreas</MT>
<MT>diabetes</MT> is very widespread <MT>metabolic disorder</MT>
studies have estimated that in there were million people infected with the <MT>disease</MT> worldwide and according to several estimations the number will reach million by this is chronic condition that may remain silent for long periods and the <MT>progression of the disease</MT>
the most important step you can take to treat <MT>diabetes naturally without drugs</MT> lose weight <MT>obesity</MT>
<MT>abdominal obesity</MT> is even more dangerous and is an important and independent risk factor for the occurrence of <MT>hyperlipidemia</MT> <MT>hypertension</MT> <MT>cardiovascular disease</MT> and <MT>diabetes</MT> especially type this happens because <MT>visceral fat</MT> is not an inert tissue but is actually an <MT>endocrine organ</MT> that produces many <MT>hormones</MT> that regulate the energy homeostasis of the body and affects the secretion of insulin that can cause <MT><MT>inflammation</MT> in the blood vessels</MT>
<MT>visceral fat</MT> may cause <MT>weight gain high</MT> levels of fasting <MT>glucose</MT> and <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
safe indicator of <MT>abdominal obesity</MT> is the measurement of waist
waist circumference should be under cm for men and under cm for women
in conclusion increased levels of <MT>visceral fat</MT> is major risk factor for developing type <MT>diabetes</MT> and should be addressed by any <MT>diabetic patient</MT> that wishes to treat the <MT>disease</MT>
what is more it has been shown that loss of of your total body weight can represents loss of <MT>visceral fat</MT> by about which improves the function
make sure you lose weight gradually and try to adopt healthy eating
what you need to do measure your waistline
as mentioned above the limit is cm for women and cm for men
the larger the circumference of your waist the greater risk to become <MT>diabetic</MT>
if you already suffer with this condition then large waist circumference may compromise <MT>glycemic</MT> control since it reduces the body ability to handle <MT>glucose</MT> while increasing <MT>insulin</MT>
regularly check the <MT>levels of lipids</MT> and <MT>glucose in the blood</MT>
now pay close attention here to control type <MT>diabetes</MT> there is an amazing method that can help you reverse the <MT>disease</MT>
<MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is probably the most serious medical condition that you haven heard
so what is <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> why is it so serious and why haven you heard
here is what you need to know
the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is cluster of the most dangerous <MT>heart attack</MT> risk factors <MT>raised blood glucose central adiposity</MT> often called beer belly abnormal <MT>cholesterol levels</MT> abnormal <MT>blood fats</MT> also called <MT>triglycerides</MT> and <MT>high blood pressure</MT>
it is estimated that in adults have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and the condition becomes more common as we get older so that by the age of nearly third of adults have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
so why is <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
well if you have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> you are much more likely to suffer <MT>heart attack</MT> or stroke more likely to develop full blown <MT>diabetes</MT> more likely to develop cancer and more likely to develop <MT>alzheimer disease</MT>
all of these conditions
<MT>dementia</MT> and <MT>alzheimer disease</MT> have overtaken cancer and <MT>heart disease</MT> as the leading cause of death in england and wales in and the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and <MT>diabetes</MT>
so how can you check to see if you have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
well first of all get out tape measure
if you are man and your waist circumference is more than cm or if you are woman and your waist is more than cm you have one of the main features of <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
if in addition you have any of the following you will be classified as having <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> <MT>raised blood triglycerides</MT> <MT>reduced hdl cholesterol</MT> sometimes known as good <MT>cholesterol</MT> <MT>raised blood pressure</MT> or <MT>raised fasting plasma glucose</MT>
note if you are man of south asian or indian heritage the important threshold for waist circumference is cm
<MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> has not yet been classified as <MT>disease</MT> it is still regarded as collection of signs and symptoms which together are serious risk factors for our most deadly and disabling medical conditions
several medical organisations such as the world health organisation who the independent <MT>diabetes</MT> federation idf and the european group for the study of <MT>insulin resistance</MT> egir define the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> in very slightly different ways and this adds even more to the confusion about what exactly <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
however many experts now believe that the underlying problem in <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
<MT>insulin resistance</MT> develops when this <MT>hormone</MT> cannot work properly when <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> are abnormally high and still relatively ineffective in keeping <MT>blood glucose levels</MT>
<MT>metabolic</MT> specialists now use the term <MT>insulin resistance syndrome</MT>
<MT>insulin</MT> is <MT>hormone</MT> produced by the <MT>pancreas</MT> and it is important in the <MT>metabolism</MT> of <MT>carbohydrates</MT> and <MT>fats</MT>
when sugar and <MT>carbohydrates</MT> are eaten <MT>insulin</MT> promotes the uptake of <MT>glucose</MT> from the <MT>blood</MT> into <MT>muscles</MT> and <MT>fat cells</MT>
hence it is often said that <MT>insulin</MT> allows cells to use <MT>glucose</MT> for energy and also to store excess <MT>glucose</MT> and sugar as <MT>glycogen</MT> and <MT>fat</MT>
when <MT>blood glucose levels</MT> fall stored <MT>glucose</MT> is released for energy from the breakdown of <MT>glycogen</MT> stores in the <MT>liver</MT> and in the <MT>muscles</MT>
in the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
fasting <MT>blood levels of insulin</MT> in the morning are often abnormally high and <MT>insulin levels</MT> rise to very high levels when food is eaten
continuously <MT>high levels of insulin</MT> cause the <MT>liver cells</MT> to store <MT>fat</MT> resulting in <MT>fatty liver</MT> which cannot function
as the <MT>insulin resistance</MT> worsens the <MT>pancreas</MT> may not be able to produce enough <MT>insulin</MT> in response to food and then <MT>glucose levels in the blood</MT>
so why haven you heard
well until quite recently the connection between <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and host of <MT>chronic diseases</MT>
we now know that <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
until recently it was difficult to measure <MT>blood insulinlevels</MT> but the technology has improved and we can now measure <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> accurately and we have good tests to diagnose <MT>insulin resistance</MT> as well as good strategies to reverse <MT>insulin resistance</MT> and the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>

<MT>leptin</MT> and the neural circuit regulation food intake and <MT>glucose metabolism</MT> <MT>air</MT> date wednesday january pm category wals wednesday afternoon lectures runtime description nih director wednesday afternoon lecture series the discovery of <MT>leptin</MT> has led to the elucidation of robust physiologic system that maintains <MT>fat</MT> stores at relatively constant level
<MT>leptin</MT> is <MT>peptide hormone</MT> secreted by <MT>adipose tissue</MT> in proportion to its <MT>mass</MT>
this <MT>hormone</MT> circulates in blood and acts on the <MT>hypothalamus</MT> to regulate food intake and <MT>energy expenditure</MT>
when <MT>fat</MT> <MT>mass</MT> falls <MT>plasma</MT> <MT>leptin</MT> levels fall stimulating appetite and suppressing <MT>energy expenditure</MT>
when <MT>fat</MT> <MT>mass</MT> increases <MT>leptin</MT>
by such mechanism total energy stores are stably maintained within relatively narrow range
recessive mutations in the <MT>leptin</MT> gene are associated with massive <MT>obesity</MT>
treatment with recombinant <MT>leptin</MT> markedly reduces food intake
the low <MT>leptin</MT> levels in patients with <MT>leptin</MT> mutations are also associated with multiple abnormalities including <MT>infertility</MT> diabetes and immune abnormalities all of which are corrected by <MT>leptin</MT> treatment
these findings have established important links between energy stores and many other physiologic systems and led to the use of <MT>leptin</MT> as treatment for an increasing number of other human conditions including subset of <MT>obesity</MT> some forms of <MT>diabetes</MT> including <MT>lipodystrophy</MT> and <MT>hypothalamic amenorrhea</MT> the <MT>cessation of menstruation</MT>
identification of <MT>physiologic system</MT> that controls energy balance establishes biologic basis for <MT>obesity</MT>
recent studies have explored the relationship between <MT>leptin</MT>
in addition new methods for identifying <MT>neurons</MT> activated by <MT>leptin</MT> and other stimuli have been developed as have methods for noninvasively activating cells
these new approaches are being applied to studies

if in the us use this link an introductory lesson into the nature of <MT>tissue</MT> fluid formation and <MT>lymphatic drainage</MT>
includes brief introduction into the functions of <MT>lymphatic drainage</MT> in health and <MT>disease</MT> the <MT>lymphatic system</MT> the <MT>lymphatic system</MT> consists of the <MT>lymphatic drainage vessels</MT>
<MT>lymphatic tissue</MT> is also sometimes referred to as lymphoid tissue
<MT>lymphatic drainage</MT> structures <MT>lymphatic capillaries</MT> <MT>drain</MT>
most of the tissue fluid formed at the <MT>arterial</MT> end of the <MT>capillary</MT> is as we have seen reabsorbed back into the blood at the <MT>venous end</MT>
however along with tissue <MT>fluid few protein</MT> molecules also escape from the <MT>capillaries</MT>
if these large <MT>osmotic molecules</MT> were allowed to remain in the tissue fluid they would increase the osmotic potential leading to an accumulation of water
an <MT>excess of fluid</MT> in the tissues is abnormal and is termed <MT>oedema</MT>
if <MT>excess tissue fluid</MT> was allowed to accumulate this would cause <MT>swelling</MT> and would increase the diffusional distance between the blood and tissue cells
this would reduce the speed at which oxygen could be delivered to tissue cells
the mechanism which removes exuded proteins from the tissue fluid preventing oedema is the <MT>lymphatic drainage</MT>
once <MT>fluid</MT> has passed from the tissue spaces into <MT>lymphatic vessel</MT>
unlike <MT>blood capillaries</MT> the <MT>lymphatic capillaries</MT>
however like <MT>blood capillaries</MT>
<MT>lymphatic capillaries</MT> are highly permeable and will absorb <MT>excess tissue fluid</MT> and infecting <MT>bacteria</MT> as well as proteins
<MT>endothelial cells</MT> which compose the <MT>lymphatic capillary walls</MT>
the cells also <MT>overlap</MT> to form <MT>valves</MT>
this means fluid and other material is able to enter from the <MT>tissue spaces</MT> but may not escape back out from the <MT>lymphatic capillaries</MT>
as <MT>lymphatic capillary</MT> fills with lymph the pressure in the lumen will close the <MT>valves</MT>
its strange the <MT>lymphatic system</MT>
<MT>diabetes</MT> treatment in nadipathy what is <MT>diabetes</MT> it is the condition that body cannot balance the <MT>glucose levels</MT> due to lack of energy to <MT>pancreas</MT> or the body cannot utilize <MT>insulin</MT> to maintain <MT>glucose homeostasis</MT>
it was first known in the th century
again <MT>diabetes</MT> is differentiated in to two types <MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> and <MT>diabetes insipidus</MT>
<MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> is mainly caused by deficiency of <MT>insulin</MT> due to either lack of energy in <MT>pancreas</MT> or any <MT>auto immune disease</MT>
while <MT>diabetes insipidus</MT> is caused by defect in secretion of <MT>vasopressin antidiuretic hormone</MT> which is secreted from <MT>pituitary gland</MT> present in <MT>hypothalamus</MT>
its function is to reabsorb water from distal tubules in the <MT>kidney</MT>
but its deficiency caused increased water excretion through urine even in low intake of water
<MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> and <MT>diabetes insipidus</MT> are unrelated although they have similar signs and symptoms like excessive thirst and <MT>excessive urination</MT>
<MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> is more common than the <MT>diabetes insipidus</MT>

<MT>nadi diagnose</MT> <MT>nadi</MT> can be measured in the superficial middle and deep levels thus obtaining more information regarding energy imbalance
when the body becomes weak
if any one of the <MT>nadi</MT> not working properly it multiplies gradually
decreases its energy that reflects gradually in the subtle body and it change as <MT>disease</MT> on the physical body
modern doctors can recognize <MT>diseases</MT>
our body is making up with <MT>nadi</MT> all the <MT>nadi</MT> are inter linked to every <MT>organ</MT>
if there is any blockage to such nadi it does not work properly
so those <MT>organs</MT> get lack of energy to function
before to the treatment nadipathy treats on the root
treatment method by using <MT>acupuncture acupressure</MT> marma therapy vedic therapy magnet therapy seed therapy massage therapy cupping therapy detoxifation therapy naturopathy beach sand therapy and some other natural therapies to remove the waste materials excess heat present inside the body
we treat the <MT>spinal cord</MT> function as normal with side effects
the duration of the treatment was day to week
<MT>nadipathy treatment</MT> will tell you what the healthy lifestyles are for <MT>cervical spondylosis</MT>
which kind of patients should do some mild exercises and under what circumstances should patients have good rest and totally avoid exercises
nadipathy can not only be used to treated the problem it can also be used by those that are at high risk of developing <MT>chronic problems</MT> and healthy people to help prevent other <MT>diseases</MT>
if <MT>nadipathy treatment</MT> is received early it can help prevent the patient disease so as to help avoid entering in to surgeries

<MT>diabetes</MT> treatment in nadipathy what is <MT>diabetes</MT> it is the condition that body cannot balance the <MT>glucose levels</MT> due to lack of energy to <MT>pancreas</MT> or the body cannot utilize <MT>insulin</MT> to maintain <MT>glucose homeostasis</MT>
it was first known in the th century
again <MT>diabetes</MT> is differentiated in to two types <MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> and <MT>diabetes insipidus</MT>
<MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> is mainly caused by deficiency of <MT>insulin</MT> due to either lack of energy in <MT>pancreas</MT> or any <MT>auto immune disease</MT>
while <MT>diabetes insipidus</MT> is caused by defect in secretion of <MT>vasopressin antidiuretic hormone</MT> which is secreted from <MT>pituitary gland</MT> present in <MT>hypothalamus</MT>
its function is to reabsorb water from distal tubules in the <MT>kidney</MT>
but its deficiency caused increased water excretion through urine even in low intake of water
<MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> and <MT>diabetes insipidus</MT> are unrelated although they have similar signs and symptoms like excessive thirst and <MT>excessive urination</MT>
<MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> is more common than the <MT>diabetes insipidus</MT>

<MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is probably the most serious medical condition that you haven heard
so what is <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> why is it so serious and why haven you heard
here is what you need to know
the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is cluster of the most dangerous <MT>heart attack</MT> risk factors <MT>raised blood glucose central adiposity</MT> often called beer belly abnormal <MT>cholesterol levels</MT> abnormal <MT>blood fats</MT> also called <MT>triglycerides</MT> and <MT>high blood pressure</MT>
it is estimated that in adults have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and the condition becomes more common as we get older so that by the age of nearly third of adults have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
so why is <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
well if you have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> you are much more likely to suffer <MT>heart attack</MT> or stroke more likely to develop full blown <MT>diabetes</MT> more likely to develop cancer and more likely to develop <MT>alzheimer disease</MT>
all of these conditions
<MT>dementia</MT> and <MT>alzheimer disease</MT> have overtaken cancer and <MT>heart disease</MT> as the leading cause of death in england and wales in and the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and <MT>diabetes</MT>
so how can you check to see if you have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
well first of all get out tape measure
if you are man and your waist circumference is more than cm or if you are woman and your waist is more than cm you have one of the main features of <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
if in addition you have any of the following you will be classified as having <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> <MT>raised blood triglycerides</MT> <MT>reduced hdl cholesterol</MT> sometimes known as good <MT>cholesterol</MT> <MT>raised blood pressure</MT> or <MT>raised fasting plasma glucose</MT> 
note if you are man of south asian or indian heritage the important threshold for waist circumference is cm
<MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> has not yet been classified as <MT>disease</MT> it is still regarded as collection of signs and symptoms which together are serious risk factors for our most deadly and disabling medical conditions
several medical organisations such as the world health organisation who the independent <MT>diabetes</MT> federation idf and the european group for the study of <MT>insulin resistance</MT> egir define the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> in very slightly different ways and this adds even more to the confusion about what exactly <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
however many experts now believe that the underlying problem in <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
<MT>insulin resistance</MT> develops when this <MT>hormone</MT> cannot work properly when <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> are abnormally high and still relatively ineffective in keeping <MT>blood glucose levels</MT>
metabolic specialists now use the term <MT>insulin resistance syndrome</MT>
<MT>insulin</MT> is <MT>hormone</MT> produced by the <MT>pancreas</MT> and it is important in the <MT>metabolism</MT> of <MT>carbohydrates</MT> and <MT>fats</MT>
when sugar and <MT>carbohydrates</MT> are eaten <MT>insulin</MT> promotes the uptake of <MT>glucose</MT> from the <MT>blood</MT> into <MT>muscles</MT> and <MT>fat cells</MT>
hence it is often said that <MT>insulin</MT> allows cells to use <MT>glucose</MT> for energy and also to store excess <MT>glucose</MT> and sugar as <MT>glycogen</MT> and <MT>fat</MT>
when <MT>blood glucose levels</MT> fall stored <MT>glucose</MT> is released for energy from the breakdown of <MT>glycogen</MT> stores in the <MT>liver</MT> and in the <MT>muscles</MT>
in the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
fasting <MT>blood levels of insulin</MT> in the morning are often abnormally high and <MT>insulin levels</MT> rise to very high levels when food is eaten
continuously high <MT>levels of insulin</MT> cause the <MT>liver cells</MT> to store <MT>fat</MT> resulting in <MT>fatty liver</MT> which cannot function
as the <MT>insulin resistance</MT> worsens the <MT>pancreas</MT> may not be able to produce enough <MT>insulin</MT> in response to food and then <MT>glucose levels in the blood</MT>
so why haven you heard
well until quite recently the connection between <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and host of <MT>chronic diseases</MT>
we now know that <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
until recently it was difficult to measure <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> but the technology has improved and we can now measure <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> accurately and we have good tests to diagnose <MT>insulin resistance</MT> as well as good strategies to reverse <MT>insulin resistance</MT> and the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
once you can measure <MT>insulin resistance</MT> you are well on your way to fixing
there is strong connection between type <MT>diabetes</MT> and <MT>dyslipidemia</MT>
this animation describes the <MT>lipid abnormalities</MT> commonly seen in patients with type <MT>diabetes</MT> <MT>elevated levels of triglycerides</MT> <MT>raised small dense ldl levels</MT> <MT>increased glycation</MT> and <MT>oxidation of ldls</MT>

<MT>diabetes</MT> and <MT>migraines</MT> an unlikely combination in the there was suggested link between <MT>diabetes</MT> and <MT>migraines</MT>
it was simple people who had <MT>diabetes</MT> were less likely to complain about <MT>migraines diabetes</MT> is lifelong condition that can cause person <MT>blood glucose sugar level</MT> to become dangerously high it affects approx million people in the uk there are two types type is where your own bodies <MT>immune system cells attack</MT> and destroy the cells that produce <MT>insulin</MT> the <MT>hormone</MT> that reduces your <MT>blood sugar levels</MT> type is where your body either doesn produce enough <MT>insulin</MT> or your cells don respond to <MT>insulin</MT> in both circumstances it means your <MT>blood glucose levels</MT> are not reduced and this is life threatening <MT>migraine</MT> is recurring <MT>headache</MT> that feels like severe <MT>throbbing pain</MT> on one side of the head symptoms can also include <MT><MT>nausea</MT> <MT>vomiting</MT></MT> and an increase in sensitivity to light or sound
it affects out of women and out of men
this is based on work done by ippazio antonazzo at the university of bergen in norway
they looked at the drug prescription records of the under adult population of norway over year period there were million people in the study
of these were being treated for type <MT>diabetes</MT> and for type <MT>diabetes</MT> they then looked at what proportion of these went on to get <MT>migraine</MT> medication compared to non diabetics their finding people with <MT>diabetes</MT> were less likely to be treated for <MT>migraine</MT> what they did not know if it was the <MT>disease</MT> or the medication that meant they were less likely to develop <MT>migraines</MT> it is thought that the <MT>nerve damage</MT> caused by <MT>diabetes</MT> makes it much more difficult to sense <MT>migraine</MT>
one of the side effects of <MT>diabetes</MT> is <MT>nerve damage</MT> reducing sensation in the hands and feet this may also occur in the head
or it could be that the link is genetic
in some people who experience <MT>migraines</MT> they have mutation in <MT>gene</MT> that codes for protein which is sensitive to the <MT>hormone insulin</MT>
<MT>insulin</MT> is the <MT>hormone</MT> produced when your <MT>blood glucose level</MT> increases and this is what is missing in type one <MT>diabetes</MT> and not detected by some cells in type <MT>diabetes</MT> so if people who have this mutation and develop <MT>migraines</MT>
diabetics then treating <MT>diabetes</MT> would also normalise the <MT>insulin levels</MT> and decrease the occurrence of <MT>migraines</MT>

how to boost <MT>insulin</MT>
the answer is simple current <MT>diabetes</MT> theory is false and so are its treatments
as the proof of the pudding is in the eating
unfortunately the medical pudding
listen why
medicine <MT>diabetes</MT> type results from the <MT>autoimmune</MT> destruction of <MT>insulin producing beta cells</MT> in the <MT>pancreas</MT>
<MT>autoimmune diseases</MT> arise from an <MT>abnormal immune response</MT> of the body against substances and tissues normally present in the body <MT>autoimmunity</MT>
in other words our <MT>immune system</MT> which protects us against <MT>microbes</MT> and viruses may destroy <MT>insulin producing beta cells</MT>
did it occur to you that <MT>autoimmunity</MT> is strictly human <MT>disease</MT>
no living entity with an <MT>immune system</MT>
the <MT>autoimmunity</MT>
this false theory recommends also wrong treatment
two theories <MT>viral theory virus cell  destruction</MT> <MT>lysis necrosis</MT> transforms self to foreign <MT>antigens</MT>
<MT>antigens</MT> trigger <MT>inflammation</MT> and repair
organism may regenerate cells <MT>auto immunity</MT> <MT>molecular mimicry</MT> confuses <MT>immune system</MT>
self <MT>peptide</MT> becomes an <MT>auto antigen</MT> <MT>auto antigen</MT> triggers <MT>inflammation</MT>
<MT>inflammation</MT>
cells
organism does not regenerate cells finally explain how to boost <MT>insulin</MT>
if you know someone struggling with their mental health digestion is typically involved in the process
this case study demonstrates the power and efficacy of functional medicine
landmark discovery about how <MT>insulin docks on cells</MT> could help in the development of improved types of <MT>insulin</MT>
associate professor mike lawrence from the walter and eliza hall institute in melbourne australia explains how the research team captured the intricate way in which <MT>insulin</MT> uses the <MT>insulin receptor</MT>
this binding is necessary for the cells

herbal therapi keeps cells healthy by supporting <MT>insulin</MT> production and helping lower <MT>blood sugar levels</MT>
since what we eat has direct correlation to how the body functions and heals proper nutrition is vital in helping the body reverse <MT>diabetes</MT>
due to how powerful food can be in improving health we ve created nutritional guide that helps create the environment necessary for the body to heal and repair
this nutritional guide
through following the program many individuals have seen improvements in their health energy levels and an overall renewed sense of life as they ve seen and felt the health of their body
<MT>diabetes insulin</MT> and the <MT>pancreas diabetes</MT> is <MT>disease</MT> that isn manifested until conditions
<MT>diabetes</MT> impedes the body
it important to remember that most of the nutrients we eat are converted into sugar
the sugar
the <MT>pancreas</MT> is an <MT>organ</MT> that makes <MT>insulin</MT> to help transport <MT>glucose sugar</MT>
when too much sugar is present the <MT>pancreas</MT> continues to produce <MT>insulin</MT> and the <MT>liver</MT> does its job of converting excess sugar into <MT>fat</MT>
this <MT>fat</MT> is then stored against <MT>organs</MT> including the <MT>pancreas</MT>
these conditions lead
first overproduction of <MT>insulin</MT> causes an overload of work which leads to the body inability to produce more <MT>insulin</MT> or use the existing <MT>insulin</MT>
second overabundance of <MT>fat</MT> around the <MT>pancreas</MT> leads to <MT>trauma</MT> and damage
<MT>pancreatic cells</MT> become sick and are unable to create good <MT>insulin</MT>
initially any healthy cells make up for sick ones by doubling efforts to create the amount of <MT>insulin</MT>
this is why early detection of <MT>diabetes</MT>
once <MT>diabetes</MT>
sugar continues to build up leading to <MT>nerve damage</MT>
additional complications include <MT>kidney failure</MT> lsos of sight lower extremity <MT>amputations</MT> and <MT>heart</MT> and <MT>digestive problems</MT>

margo hudson md co director <MT>polycystic ovary syndrome</MT> program in the fish center for women health at brigham and women hospital describes causes symptoms and treatment for <MT>polycystic ovary syndrome</MT>
<MT>polycystic ovary syndrome</MT> pcos is group of symptoms rather than specific <MT>disease</MT>
while the <MT>ovaries</MT> may develop <MT>cysts</MT> that is not necessary for the diagnosis of <MT>pcos</MT>
many patients who have <MT>pcos</MT> are overweight or <MT>obese</MT>
it is one of the most common <MT>hormonal</MT> and <MT>reproductive conditions</MT>
the primary cause of <MT>pcos</MT> may be due to abnormal production of certain <MT>hormones</MT> in the <MT>brain</MT>
this disruption leads to an increase in the production of <MT>male hormones</MT> such as <MT>testosterone</MT> and <MT>inhibition of ovulation</MT>
the most common symptom of <MT>pcos</MT>
other symptoms include <MT>acne</MT> <MT>cardiovascular disease</MT> excessive body hair particularly facial hair infertility <MT>insulin resistance</MT> or <MT>pre diabetes</MT>
because women with <MT>pcos</MT> can exhibit variety of symptoms
treatment is tailored according to the particular symptoms
medical therapies are often used to regulate <MT>menstrual cycles</MT> reduce <MT>testosterone levels</MT> lower <MT>insulin levels</MT> improve <MT>insulin sensitivity</MT> and eliminate <MT>unwanted hair</MT>
nutrition education will help reduce excess weight
located at the gretchen and edward fish center for women health in the brigham and women health care center in excess weight hill the <MT>polycystic ovary syndrome</MT> program brings together experts in <MT>gynecology endocrinology dermatology nutrition</MT> and other specialties to deliver comprehensive individualized and coordinated care for women with <MT>pcos</MT>

it is very serious health problem throughout the world effecting thousands of people survey conducted in united states showed that almost of the population suffers
it is matter of great issue that almost one third of the population is unaware of the <MT>disease</MT>
what is <MT>diabetes</MT>
<MT>diabetes</MT> is <MT>disease</MT> in which the body ability to produce or respond to the <MT>hormone insulin</MT> is impaired resulting in abnormal <MT>metabolism</MT> of <MT>carbohydrates</MT> and <MT>elevated levels of glucose</MT>
how to cure <MT>diabetes</MT>

vivian fonseca md robert henry md julio rosenstock md peter salgo md and carol wysham md review the risks and benefits of early <MT>insulin</MT>
what is type <MT>diabetes</MT>
type <MT>diabetes</MT> is condition in which your body has <MT>high blood sugar</MT>
how does your <MT>blood sugar</MT>
if you have <MT>insulin resistance</MT> your <MT>insulin</MT> cannot unlock the cells to let <MT>glucose</MT> in because the locks called the receptors
as result <MT>glucose</MT> is locked out up of your cells
consequently the amount of <MT>glucose</MT> builds up in the <MT>blood stream</MT> in condition called <MT>hyperglycaemia</MT>
how do we lose the ability to create <MT>insulin</MT>
to compensate for <MT>hyperglycaemia</MT> your <MT>pancreas</MT> produces more and more <MT>insulin</MT>
your over worked <MT>beta cells</MT> try to keep up with the demand but gradually lose their capability to produce enough <MT>insulin</MT>
if you don receive treatment for <MT>hyperglycaemia</MT> it can result in <MT>diabetic ketoacidosis</MT> as there will be shortage of <MT>insulin</MT> in the body
over time chronic poorly controlled type <MT>diabetes</MT> can cause degenerative <MT>tissue damage</MT> resulting in long term complications such as <MT>atherosclerosis</MT> <MT>blindness neuropathy</MT> <MT>heart attack</MT> and <MT>renal failure</MT>

one powerful antioxidant produced by the body is <MT>alpha lipoic acid</MT>
<MT>alpha lipoic acid</MT> is found in every cell of the human
both water soluble and fat soluble so able to act throughout the body
antioxidants attack <MT>free radicals</MT> which are waste products that occur when the body creates energy through the food we eat
<MT>free radicals</MT> can also come from exposure to <MT>toxins</MT> and pollutants

how else can <MT>ala</MT>
<MT>ala for fat</MT> loss and building <MT>muscle</MT> multiple studies have found <MT>ala</MT>
one study followed <MT>obese</MT> diabetic patients for weeks with either <MT>mg</MT> supplementation of ala per day or <MT>placebo</MT> and found significant effect on body mass index and <MT>triglyceride levels</MT> decreasing bmi and <MT>triglyceride levels</MT> in the subjects with oral <MT>ala</MT> supplementation
protection against <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
<MT>insulin resistance</MT> leads to decreased <MT>glucose</MT> uptake in <MT>fat</MT> and <MT>muscle cells</MT>
<MT>ala</MT> helps to turn <MT>glucose</MT> into energy or fuel for your body through <MT>insulin</MT> signaling when <MT>insulin</MT> binds to the <MT>insulin receptor</MT> cascade of events is started leading to increased <MT>cellular</MT>
<MT>ala</MT> has been shown to activate this cascade of events leading to increased <MT>glucose</MT> uptake in <MT>fat</MT> and <MT>muscle cells</MT>
this is done not through an effect on <MT>insulin levels</MT> but by triggering the same sequence of events leading to <MT>glucose</MT> transport for energy creation
<MT>ala</MT> sort of mimics <MT>insulin</MT>
studies have shown that this shuttling allows more <MT>glucose</MT> to enter <MT>skeletal muscle cells</MT> thus more <MT>glucose</MT> burned as for energy more energy to tear and rebuild <MT>muscles</MT> and less shuttled to be stored as <MT>fat</MT>
when more <MT>glucose</MT> is delivered to <MT>muscle cells</MT> there is less available to be stored as <MT>fat</MT>
so you have more fuel to push muscle growth and less <MT>glucose</MT> stored in <MT>fat</MT> cells muscle growth and less <MT>fat</MT>

this video and other related images videos in hd are available for instant download licensing here
<MT>hypokalemia</MT> may result from increased excretion inadequate intake or shift of <MT>potassium</MT> from the <MT>extracellular fluid</MT> into the cells
most commonly <MT>hypokalemia</MT> is caused by excessive loss of <MT>potassium</MT> in the <MT>urine</MT> from the <MT>gi tract</MT> or skin
the cause is usually apparent by the patient history of predisposing diseases or medication
<MT>urine potassium levels</MT> are measured to differentiate between <MT>renal</MT> and <MT>non renal</MT>
symptoms may include <MT>muscle weakness</MT>
as <MT>potassium levels</MT> decrease in the <MT>extracellular space</MT> the magnitude of the <MT>potassium</MT>
this moves
the result is reduced excitability or responsiveness of the <MT>neurons</MT> and <MT>muscles</MT>
in the <MT>heart</MT>
this is because <MT>hyper polarization</MT> enhances the funny currents in <MT>cardiac pacemaker cells</MT>
the effect is greatest in <MT>purkinje fibers</MT> as these are more sensitive to <MT>potassium levels</MT> as compared to the <MT>sa node</MT>
increased automaticity of <MT>purkinje fibers</MT> may lead to the development of one or more <MT>ectopic pacemaker</MT> sites in the <MT>ventricles</MT> causing <MT>ventricular premature beats tachycardia</MT> and <MT>fibrillation</MT>
reduced <MT>extracellular potassium</MT> also inhibits
as <MT>hypokalemia</MT> becomes more severe especially in patients with other <MT>heart</MT> conditions
prolonged repolarization may also promote <MT>re entrant arrhythmias</MT>
early ecg changes
these include flattening or inversion of wave increasingly prominent wave st segment depression and prolonged qu interval
<MT>hypokalemia</MT> induced <MT>arrhythmias</MT> require immediate <MT>potassium replacement</MT>

if <MT>potassium</MT> infusion is indicated <MT>continuous cardiac monitoring</MT> and hourly <MT>serum potassium</MT> determinations must be performed to avoid <MT>hyperkalemia</MT> complications
many of the major illnesses that face us today have their origin in disturbances in our <MT>metabolism</MT> or at the very least they are made worse by <MT>metabolic problems</MT>

and traditional advice on portion control weight management and eating <MT>starchy carbohydrates</MT> with every meal often does not help type diabetics many of whom see their illness as chronic and progressive with relentless deterioration towards more medication and eventually the prospect of <MT>insulin injections</MT>
furthermore despite the fact that most of us are eating quantities of food far in excess of our energy requirements many of us still have <MT>nutritional deficiencies</MT> such as vitamin and <MT>other vitamins minerals</MT> such as magnesium and deficiencies of essential <MT>fats</MT> such as <MT>omega</MT> the <MT>melbury metabolic clinic</MT> offers an assessment of the common <MT>metabolic disturbances</MT> <MT>glucose</MT> <MT>metabolism</MT> <MT>pre diabetes diabetes</MT> <MT>insulin resistance</MT> abnormal <MT>liver function vitamin deficiency</MT> <MT>magnesium deficiency</MT> <MT>omega deficiency level of <MT>inflammation</MT></MT> we offer patient centred individualised assessments to help you on correct any <MT>metabolic disturbances</MT> that you may have in order help you lose weight avoid or control <MT>diabetes</MT> and to reduce or eliminate <MT>blood pressure</MT> medication

natural healing herbalist and <MT>herbs</MT> have written about these disorders
in this article will bring them together
whenever you have an epidemic on the scale
one of the primary influences in our cancer epidemic is <MT>insulin resistance diabetes</MT>
right now there are about million diabetics in the however there are about million people with <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
<MT>insulin resistance</MT> is the <MT>pre diabetic</MT> condition that has many of the destructive elements
what this adds up to is that million people have developed one of the main foundations that cancer can build on
when patient has been diagnosed with cancer and has <MT>insulin resistance type diabetes</MT>
there are many reasons why
it is also true that the ramifications of <MT>insulin resistance type diabetes</MT> are not handled with enough depth in both the diagnosis and <MT>treatment of cancer</MT>
<MT>insulin resistance diabetes</MT>
many of these negative changes favor
cancer is an opportunistic disorder
once it has developed in our bodies it applies everything and anything it can to further its ends and <MT>insulin resistance type diabetes</MT>

what way noni helps in <MT>diabetes</MT>
the miracle of xeronine xeronine the <MT>alkaloid</MT> of noni in the presence of <MT>insulin</MT> activate the <MT>peripheral cell membrane</MT> <MT>insulin receptors</MT> and helps for the normal <MT>intracellular absorption</MT> of <MT>glucose</MT> as well as corrects the intracellular post <MT>receptor defect of the action of insulin</MT> for <MT>carbohydrate metabolism</MT> and thus prevents the <MT>insulin resistance condition in diabetes</MT>
noni the cell rejuvenator noni is believed to fortify and maintain the <MT>cell structure</MT> this can be accomplished by noni acting as an adaptogen that can aid sick
xeronine and other nutraceuticals present in noni may convert the abnormal inactive <MT>insulin</MT> molecule present in type <MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> to an active form by modifying its cell rigidity and functional level to maintain its normal function of <MT>carbohydrate metabolism</MT>in our body
noni works as healthy <MT>immune system promoter</MT> one of the nonis effects is on the <MT>pancreas</MT> and <MT>immune system</MT>
current studies have revealed that noni may help promote healthy <MT>immune system</MT> or by either enhancing an already functioning system
noni activating our body <MT>immune system</MT> may improve the non functioning <MT>beta cells of the pancreas</MT> to an active form to produce the normal <MT>insulin</MT> from the <MT>beta cells</MT> and also maintain normal <MT>insulin level in the blood</MT> to the response of the <MT>carbohydrate diet</MT>
<MT>low glycemic index ratio of carbohydrates</MT> to fiber in noni juice helps balance <MT>blood glucose level</MT>
<MT>glycemic index</MT> refers to method of classification by which number is assigned to foods based on how they affect <MT>blood sugar levels</MT>
foods that contain the same amount of <MT>total carbohydrate</MT>
for example kidney beans increase <MT>blood sugar levels</MT> more significantly than soya beans because of its <MT>higher glycemic</MT>
noni has very <MT>low glycemic index</MT> and hence it reduces the risk of chronic conditions of <MT>diabetics</MT> noni might have the role by modifying our body <MT>immune system</MT> keeps the sensitivity of <MT>beta cells of the pancreas</MT> intact to produce an adequate amount of <MT>insulin</MT> in response to <MT>elevated blood glucose level</MT> by keeping and maintaining the balance of  release of the neuro <MT>endocrine</MT>
noni may help the <MT>diabetic complications</MT> like care of <MT>diabetic gangrene</MT> by its powerful healing effects and also helps <MT>diabetic poly neuropathy</MT> symptoms by providing number essential micronutrients vitamins essential minerals and <MT>amino acids</MT>
noni may also help relieve <MT>diabetic complications</MT> through its ability to stimulate the bodys production of <MT>nitric oxide</MT>
<MT>nitric oxide</MT> and <MT>scopoletin</MT> one ingredient in noni helps also reduce the <MT>diabetic hypertension</MT>
both may also be important factors in decreasing symptoms
hence it is the gods gift to the human society

animated chinwe ntamere voice over rebecca yang script in normal person <MT>beta cells within the pancreas</MT> secrete what known as <MT>insulin</MT> into the <MT>bloodstream</MT>
as <MT>insulin</MT> travels within the <MT>bloodstream</MT> it binds to the <MT>insulin receptors</MT> found on the cells
as <MT>insulin</MT> and <MT>insulin receptor</MT> bind together it triggers whole series of events known as cell signaling cascade which brings up the <MT>glucose transporters</MT>
and now <MT>glucose</MT> can enter the cells
this brings down the <MT>blood glucose level</MT>
however in type <MT>diabetic patient</MT> like jacob there problem
while the <MT>beta cells</MT> secrete <MT>insulin</MT> and can bind to the <MT>insulin receptors</MT> the series of cell cascading event is altered so that the <MT>glucose transporters</MT>

the human body wants <MT>blood glucose</MT>
<MT>insulin</MT> and <MT>glucagon</MT> are the <MT>hormones</MT>
both <MT>insulin</MT> and <MT>glucagon</MT> are secreted from the <MT>pancreas</MT> and thus are referred to as <MT>pancreatic endocrine hormones</MT>
it is the production of <MT>insulin</MT> and <MT>glucagon</MT> by the <MT>pancreas</MT> which ultimately determines if patient has <MT>diabetes hypoglycemia</MT> or some other sugar
role of <MT>insulin</MT> in <MT>blood glucose control</MT> <MT>insulin</MT> and <MT>glucagon</MT> are <MT>hormones</MT> secreted by <MT>islet cells</MT> within the <MT>pancreas</MT>
they are both secreted in response to <MT>blood sugar levels</MT>
<MT>insulin</MT> is normally secreted by the <MT>beta cells of the pancreas</MT>
the stimulus for <MT>insulin secretion</MT> is <MT>high blood glucose</MT>
although there is always low level of <MT>insulin</MT> secreted by the <MT>pancreas</MT>
similarly as <MT>blood glucose</MT> falls the amount of <MT>insulin</MT> secreted by the <MT>pancreatic islets</MT>
<MT>insulin</MT> has an effect on <MT>number of cells</MT> including muscle <MT>red blood cells</MT> and <MT>fat cells</MT>
in response to <MT>insulin</MT> these cells absorb <MT>glucose out of the blood</MT> having the net effect of lowering the <MT>high blood glucose levels</MT>
<MT>glucagon</MT> is secreted by the <MT>alpha cells of the pancreatic islets</MT> in much the same manner as <MT>insulin</MT>
if <MT>blood glucose</MT> is high then no <MT>glucagon</MT>
when <MT>blood glucose</MT> goes low however more and more <MT>glucagon</MT>
like <MT>insulin glucagon</MT> has an effect on many cells of the body but most notably the <MT>liver</MT>
the role of <MT>glucagon</MT> in <MT>blood glucose control</MT> the effect of <MT>glucagon</MT> is to make the <MT>liver</MT> release the <MT>glucose</MT> it has stored in its cells into the <MT>bloodstream</MT>
<MT>glucagon</MT> also induces the <MT>liver</MT> to make <MT>glucose</MT> out of building blocks obtained from other nutrients found in the body
our bodies desire <MT>blood glucose</MT>
below is termed <MT>hypoglycemia</MT>
above can be normal if you have eaten

<MT>hypoglycemia</MT> is often precursor to <MT>type ii diabetes</MT>
if you suffer episodes of <MT>hypoglycemia</MT> you may be at greater risk for <MT>diabetes</MT>
it is good idea to avoid large <MT>carbohydrate</MT>
both the types of carbs and the amount of carbs
women with <MT>pcos</MT> have abnormal <MT>insulin</MT> regulation where there is often delay of <MT>insulin secretion</MT> with <MT>carbohydrate</MT> load then <MT>insulin secretion</MT> continues after <MT>hormone levels</MT> fall resulting in low sugars
this is thought to be due to an abnormality in <MT>insulin secreting beta cells</MT>
eventually if you lose enough of these cells you are at risk for <MT>diabetes</MT>
<MT>diabetes type</MT> and type definition and facts share your story <MT>diabetes</MT> is chronic condition associated with abnormally high levels of sugar
<MT>insulin</MT> produced by the <MT>pancreas</MT> lowers <MT>blood glucose</MT>
absence or insufficient production of <MT>insulin</MT> or an inability of the body to properly use <MT>insulin</MT> causes <MT>diabetes</MT>
the two types of <MT>diabetes</MT> are referred to as type and type former names for these conditions were <MT>insulin</MT> dependent and <MT>non insulin dependent diabetes</MT> or juvenile onset and <MT>adult onset diabetes</MT>
symptoms of type and type <MT>diabetes</MT> include <MT>increased urine output</MT> excessive thirst weight loss hunger fatigue skin problems slow healing wounds <MT>yeast infections</MT> and <MT>tingling</MT> or numbness in the feet or toes

what is <MT>diabetes</MT>
<MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> is group of <MT>metabolic diseases</MT> characterized by <MT>high blood sugar glucose levels</MT>
<MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> commonly referred to as <MT>diabetes</MT> as it will be in this article was first identified as <MT>disease</MT> associated with sweet
<MT>elevated levels of blood glucose</MT> <MT>hyperglycemia</MT> lead to <MT>spillage</MT> of <MT>glucose</MT> into the <MT>urine</MT> hence the term sweet
normally <MT>blood glucose levels</MT> are tightly controlled by <MT>insulin</MT> hormone produced by the <MT>pancreas</MT>
<MT>insulin</MT> lowers the <MT>blood glucose level</MT>
when the <MT>blood glucose</MT> elevates for example after eating food <MT>insulin</MT> is released from the <MT>pancreas</MT> to normalize the <MT>glucose level</MT>
in patients with <MT>diabetes</MT> the absence of insufficient production of or lack of response to <MT>insulin</MT> causes <MT>hyperglycemia</MT>

who is <MT>chromium picolinate</MT>
<MT>chromium picolinate</MT> is recommended for anyone wanting to enhance <MT>glucose metabolism</MT> therefore it is particularly important for those involved in sports which predominantly require <MT>glucose</MT> as an energy source hromium helps <MT>metabolize carbohydrates</MT>
it monitors <MT>blood sugar levels</MT> and helps stabilize <MT>blood sugar</MT>
it can also prevent <MT>hypertension</MT> or <MT>high blood pressure</MT>
although trials are still being conducted <MT>chromium compounds</MT> are considered helpful in preventing memory loss and in treating <MT>alzheimer disease</MT> chromium supplements are easily available in stores and come in the form of <MT>chromium picolinate chromium nictitate</MT> <MT>high chromium yeast</MT> or <MT>chromium citrate</MT>

additionally it reduces hunger which aids in weight loss
thorne research <MT>chromium picolinate</MT> dietary supplement to aid <MT>metabolism</MT> of carbs and sugar vegetarian capsules this very popular form of <MT>chromium</MT>
<MT>chromium</MT> is an essential <MT>nutrient</MT> for human life and is widely distributed in small quantities in food however the refining of flour and sugar has depleted <MT>chromium</MT>
<MT>metabolic stress</MT> strenuous exercise and pregnancy can all increase <MT>chromium</MT>
studies suggest adequate chromium intake supports already normal <MT>blood</MT> <MT>glucose</MT> levels <MT>insulin sensitivity</MT> and <MT>sperm</MT>
<MT>chromium in the form of picolinate</MT> has been widely studied for support of <MT>blood sugar</MT>
decreases in <MT>carbohydrate</MT> cravings
other studies have shown <MT>chromium picolinate</MT> can increase lean body mass in <MT>obese</MT>
<MT>picolinic acid</MT> is natural <MT>mineral chelator</MT> produced in the body
it is produced from the <MT>amino acid tryptophan</MT> in the <MT>liver</MT> and <MT>kidneys</MT> and is transported to the <MT>pancreas</MT>
during digestion it is secreted from the <MT>pancreas</MT> into the <MT>small intestine</MT> where it binds to minerals
<MT>chromium picolinate</MT> dosage for weight loss <MT>chromium picolinate</MT> supplementation may lead to an increase in weight loss

<MT>insulin</MT> produced by the <MT>pancreas</MT> lowers <MT>blood glucose</MT>
absence or insufficient production of <MT>insulin</MT> or an inability of the body to properly use <MT>insulin</MT> causes <MT>diabetes</MT> the two types of <MT>diabetes</MT> are referred to as type and type former names for these conditions were <MT>insulin</MT> dependent and <MT>non insulin dependent diabetes</MT> or juvenile onset and <MT>adult onset diabetes</MT>
<MT>diabetes</MT> treatment depends on the type and severity of the <MT>diabetes</MT>
type <MT>diabetes</MT> is treated with <MT>insulin</MT> exercise and <MT>diabetic diet</MT>
type <MT>diabetes</MT> is first treated with weight reduction type <MT>diabetic</MT> diet and exercise

<MT>diabetes</MT> is <MT>chronic disorder</MT> occurs when <MT>pancreas</MT> does not secrete enough <MT>insulin</MT> or cells become resisitant to <MT>insulin</MT> which leads to <MT>elevated blood sugar levels</MT> <MT>diabetic patients</MT> should watch over what they eat in order to keep their <MT>blood sugar levels</MT>
the patients should primarily consume vegetables containing anti oxidants minerals and vitamins that are vital for the body
it is better to avoid those vegetables containing excess of <MT>carbohydrates protein</MT> and <MT>fat</MT>
in that case four to five serving of vegetables would also not harm the body
vegetables can be eaten
they can be baked grilled or micro
you can add variety to it by making delicious salads with various sauces vegetables give the required fiber content to the human body
they promote the health and help you to prevent many <MT>diseases</MT>
vegetables reduce the risk of getting affected by <MT>chronic disorders</MT> stroke <MT>coronary heart diseases</MT> and <MT>cancers in the lungs</MT> and <MT>digestive tract</MT>
vegetables also increase the mineral density in the <MT>bones</MT> and lower the <MT>bone</MT>

<MT>peptide peptide</MT> byproduct of <MT>insulin</MT> production usually by the <MT>pancreas</MT>
the level of <MT>peptide</MT> is gauge of how much <MT>insulin</MT> is being produced in the body
<MT>peptide</MT> is made up of chemical compounds called <MT>amino acids</MT>
when the <MT>pancreas</MT> produces <MT>insulin</MT> it releases <MT>peptide</MT> into the <MT>bloodstream</MT> in the same way that the production of heat from burning coal or wood releases smoke
the amount of <MT>peptide in the blood</MT> can indicate the presence
for example abnormally low amounts of <MT>peptide in the blood</MT> suggest the <MT>insulin</MT> production is too low or absent because of type <MT>diabetes</MT> also known as <MT>juvenile</MT> or <MT>insulin dependent diabetes</MT>
abnormally high amounts of <MT>peptide</MT> warn of the possible presence of <MT>tumor</MT> called an <MT>insulinoma</MT> that secretes <MT>insulin</MT>
normal levels of <MT>peptide</MT>
however in person with <MT>diabetes</MT> normal level of <MT>peptide</MT> indicates the body is making plenty of <MT>insulin</MT> but the body
this is the hallmark of type <MT>diabetes adult insulin resistant</MT>
<MT>peptide</MT> therefore plays crucial diagnostic role as regards <MT>insulin</MT>
<MT>insulin</MT> is <MT>hormone</MT> that regulates the body use of <MT>glucose</MT>
<MT>muscle cells</MT> and other types of cells need <MT>glucose</MT>
the body manufactures <MT>glucose</MT>
it is the job of <MT>insulin</MT> to deliver <MT>glucose</MT>

about two percent of patients develop <MT>diabetes mellitus</MT>
<MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> or simply <MT>diabetes</MT> is group of <MT>metabolic diseases</MT> in which person has <MT>high blood sugar</MT> either because the <MT>pancreas</MT> does not produce enough <MT>insulin</MT> or because cells do not respond to the <MT>insulin</MT>
this <MT>high blood sugar</MT> produces the classical symptoms of <MT>polyuria</MT> <MT>frequent urination polydipsia</MT> increased thirst and <MT>polyphagia</MT> increased hunger
there are three main types of <MT>diabetes mellitus dm</MT>
type <MT>dm</MT> results from the body failure to produce <MT>insulin</MT> and currently requires the person to inject <MT>insulin</MT> or wear an <MT>insulin pump</MT>
this form was previously referred to as <MT>insulin dependent diabetes mellitus</MT> iddm or <MT>juvenile diabetes</MT>
type <MT>dm</MT> results from <MT>insulin resistance</MT></MT> condition in which cells fail to use <MT>insulin</MT> properly sometimes combined with an absolute <MT>insulin</MT>
this form was previously referred to as <MT>non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus</MT> <MT>niddm</MT> or <MT>adult onset diabetes</MT>
the third main form <MT>gestational diabetes</MT> occurs when pregnant women without previous diagnosis of <MT>diabetes</MT> develop <MT>high blood glucose level</MT>
it may precede development of type dm
other forms of <MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> include <MT>congenital diabetes</MT> which is due to genetic defects of <MT>insulin secretion</MT> <MT>cystic fibrosis</MT> related <MT>diabetes</MT> <MT>steroid diabetes</MT> induced by high doses of <MT>glucocorticoids</MT> and several forms of <MT>monogenic diabetes</MT>
untreated <MT>diabetes</MT> can cause many complications
acute complications include <MT>diabetic ketoacidosis</MT> and <MT>nonketotic hyperosmolar coma</MT>
serious long term complications include <MT>cardiovascular disease</MT> <MT>chronic renal failure</MT> and <MT>diabetic retinopathy</MT>
adequate treatment of <MT>diabetes</MT> is thus important as well as <MT>blood pressure</MT> control and lifestyle factors such as stopping
all forms of <MT>diabetes</MT> have been treatable since <MT>insulin</MT>
<MT>insulin</MT> and some oral medications can cause <MT>hypoglycemia</MT>
both types and are chronic conditions
<MT>pancreas transplants</MT> have been tried with limited success in type <MT>dm</MT> <MT>gastric</MT> bypass surgery has been successful in many with <MT>morbid obesity</MT> and type <MT>dm</MT>
<MT>gestational diabetes</MT> usually resolves after delivery
type <MT>diabetes</MT> is partly inherited and then triggered by certain <MT>infections</MT> with some evidence pointing at <MT>coxsackie virus</MT>
<MT>genetic element</MT> in individual susceptibility to some of these triggers has been traced to particular <MT>hla</MT> <MT>genotypes</MT> the genetic self identifiers relied upon by the <MT>immune system</MT>
however even in those who have inherited the susceptibility type <MT>dm</MT>
the onset of type <MT>diabetes</MT> is unrelated to lifestyle
type <MT>diabetes</MT> is due primarily to lifestyle factors and <MT>genetics hypertension</MT> htn or <MT>high blood pressure</MT> sometimes called <MT>arterial hypertension</MT> is chronic medical condition
this requires the <MT>heart</MT> to work harder than normal to circulate <MT>blood through the blood vessels</MT>
<MT>blood pressure</MT> is summarised by two measurements systolic and diastolic which depend
normal <MT>blood pressure</MT> at rest is within the range of <MT>mmhg</MT> systolic top reading and <MT>mmhg</MT> diastolic bottom reading
<MT>high blood pressure</MT>
<MT>hypertension</MT> is classified as either primary <MT>essential hypertension</MT> or <MT>secondary hypertension</MT> about of cases are categorized as <MT>primary hypertension</MT> which means <MT>high blood pressure</MT>
the remaining of cases <MT>secondary hypertension</MT> are caused by other conditions that affect the <MT>kidneys arteries</MT> heart or <MT>endocrine system</MT>

in new observations of mice and human samples of <MT> chronic kidney disease</MT> montreal researchers found that around half had <MT>elevated blood glucose levels</MT>
when they investigated further they also noted that the samples had impaired <MT>insulin secretion</MT> from <MT>pancreatic beta cells</MT>

we identified <MT>molecular mechanisms</MT> that may be responsible for increased <MT>blood glucose</MT> levels in patients with <MT>non diabetic chronic kidney disease</MT>
our observations in mice and in human samples show that the <MT>disease</MT> can cause <MT>secondary diabetes</MT>
poitout team believe that when the <MT>kidneys</MT> fail waste product called <MT>urea</MT>
this is normally filtered by the <MT>kidneys</MT> and excreted in urine but not in patients with <MT>chronic kidney disease</MT>
in patients with <MT>chronic renal failure</MT> the <MT>kidneys</MT> are no longer able to eliminate <MT>toxins</MT>
<MT>urea</MT>
this study demonstrates that <MT>urea</MT> is directly responsible for impaired <MT>insulin secretion</MT> in <MT>chronic kidney disease</MT>
the study team now plan to conduct further studies to validate these findings in humans which could lead to new treatment approaches to protect <MT>beta cells</MT> in people with <MT>kidney disease</MT>
the findings appear in the journal of clinical investigation

the best kind of exercise to control your <MT>blood sugar</MT> managing sugars</MT> during and activity
ve noticed this tested my <MT>blood sugar</MT> at pm today it was why does exercise sometimes raise <MT>blood sugar</MT>
exercise can trigger the body to release stress <MT>hormones</MT> like <MT>adrenaline</MT> which stimulates the <MT>liver</MT> to release <MT>glucose</MT> or <MT>cortisol</MT> which makes you more resistant to <MT>insulin</MT>

sometimes if <MT>insulin levels</MT> are high before you exercise they can stay you re not <MT>hi</MT> am puzzled by my bs after certain intensity exercises
dealing with unexplained <MT>blood sugar</MT>
dietitian start to exercise and <MT>ur</MT> sugars are already little high it can make them why is that sometimes my <MT>blood sugar levels</MT>
yes exercise can help you improve your <MT>blood sugar control</MT> boost overall if when have high level of <MT>ketones</MT> risk it is healthy for to rise during because the <MT>muscles body</MT> will adjust after exercising and bring levels prevent low sugar one reduce <MT>insulin</MT> increase usual based on food level then multiply dose how many different factors affect <MT>glucose</MT>
the impact brief intensity <MT>glucose</MT>
exercise and <MT>blood glucose levels</MT>
our <MT>blood sugar</MT> response will also depend on our level of physical fitness and personal exertion exercise is stressor meaning that in the short term exercising raise <MT>glucose levels</MT>
however the <MT>blood sugar level</MT> although sometimes can temporarily rise with exercise
exercise can only lower <MT>glucose</MT> when there is enough <MT>insulin</MT> available in the impact of brief high intensity exercise on <MT>blood levels</MT> suggest that physical activity reduce risk type <MT>diabetes</MT> by <MT>blood sugar levels</MT>
why some types of exercise can make your <MT>blood sugar increase control</MT> during and after beyond type <MT>diabetes</MT> and exercise when to monitor your <MT>blood sugar</MT>
basically stimulated by the demand from low <MT>insulin</MT> coupled with physical activity stimulates secretion of trigger <MT>liver</MT> to release <MT>glucose into blood</MT> thereby increasing prevent problem bg should be checked before exercise and if level exceeds more intense is greater <MT>blood</MT> can rise most commonly your is too high when you levels are likely sharply after affect has on will vary checking often help going or it good for <MT>glucose</MT>
<MT>blood glucose</MT> and exercise
<MT>blood glucose sugar levels</MT> why does my sugar go up after exercise
why exercise increase <MT>blood glucose</MT>
<MT>diabetes</MT>
know that overall exercise is supposed to lower <MT>blood sugar levels</MT>
higher intensity so having soda will cause faster rise in your <MT>blood sugar levels</MT> than exercise can have big effect on because when you high for long time it damage the <MT>vessels</MT> that supply finding of increased exercise <MT>muscles</MT> take up <MT>glucose sugar</MT> much faster resulting studies shown interval training help people <MT>burn more fat</MT> and increase fitness even after just or minutes helps body

it is not usually dangerous to exercise with <MT>high blood sugar level</MT> as long as you are spilling <MT>ketones</MT> but performance will be influenced by even controlling your <MT>glucose</MT>

provo utah researchers have found compounds in chocolate that could help prevent and treat
<MT>beta cells inside the islet </MT> of  <MT>langerhans</MT> in the <MT>pancreas</MT> are responsible for secreting <MT>insulin</MT> the <MT>hormone</MT> that regulates <MT>blood sugar levels</MT>
in someone suffering from type <MT>diabetes</MT> the <MT>beta cells</MT> malfunction and produce insufficient <MT>levels of insulin</MT>
researchers at brigham young university have discovered that compounds found naturally in cocoa called <MT>epicatechin</MT> monomers are able to increase the ability of <MT>beta cells</MT> to secrete <MT>insulin</MT>
the team said the compound successfully helped mice on <MT>high fat diet</MT> to cope with <MT>elevated blood sugar levels</MT> as well as decrease the extent of their <MT>obesity</MT>
what happens is it protecting the cells
the <MT>epicatechin</MT> monomers are making the <MT>mitochondria</MT> in the <MT>beta cells</MT> stronger which produces more <MT>atp</MT> cell energy source which then results in more <MT>insulin</MT>
the team are looking for ways to extract the compound out of cocoa in order to make treatment for current <MT>diabetes</MT> patients and advised people not to stock up on chocolate
you probably have to eat lot of cocoa and you probably don want it to have lot of sugar
it the compound in cocoa

pitt team identifies key protein causing excess <MT>liver</MT>
htm the body produces <MT>insulin</MT> but the cells in the body become resistant to <MT>insulin</MT> and are unable to use it as effectively leading to <MT>hyperglycemia</MT>
if undetected this can indicate wider health problems such as <MT>high blood pressure</MT> and <MT>cholesterol levels</MT>
what causes <MT>insulin resistance</MT> it is well known that <MT>insulin resistance</MT> commonly coexists with <MT>obesity</MT>
<MT>elevated levels of free fatty acids</MT> and <MT>triglycerides in the blood stream and tissues</MT> have been found to contribute to diminished <MT>insulin</MT>
these are correlated with excess <MT>body fat</MT>
primarily cause by dieting choice sedentary lifestyle and smoking have also been linked to the causes of <MT>insulin sensitivity</MT>
signs of <MT>high blood sugar</MT> may be warning sign that the body is developing an <MT>insulin sensitivity</MT>
additional signs include sleepiness after meals increased <MT>blood pressure</MT> as well as weight gain <MT>fat</MT>
how to manage it there are three ways to manage <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
the most important is in person diet
diet to keep your <MT>insulin resistance</MT> from increasing always eat
breakfast provides kickstart to your <MT>metabolism</MT> that plays crucial role in helping your body properly process <MT>insulin</MT>
grabbing quick snack instead of balanced meal will make it hard to keep your <MT>blood sugar levels</MT>
to reduce your body <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
whole grain rye is rich in fiber and has been shown to naturally increase your body <MT>insulin</MT>
this is directly linked to lower <MT>insulin resistance</MT> and helps to increase your body sensitivity to <MT>insulin</MT>
try eating rye pasta with food rich in <MT>lycopene</MT>
exercise start an appropriate exercise regime
choose something that is customized for current fitness levels
any exercise will vastly improve overall nutrition
you may be able lose the <MT>fat</MT> that causes <MT>insulin resistance</MT> but it will always be there waiting for you to give it foothold to take your body back
stay on track with your diet changes and increase in exercise
supplements there are variety of supplements available to help with <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
cinnamomum cassia potent extract harvested from indonesian cinnamon bark that has been shown to effectively assist in managing <MT>blood sugar</MT> it is pure does not undergo any irradiation whatsoever and is concentrated
also rare <MT>plant alkaloid</MT> called <MT>berberine</MT> which has been used for centuries
<MT>berberine</MT> works slightly differently by improving the signaling between insulin and its associated receptors while also increasing <MT>glucose</MT> uptake by <MT>skeletal muscle</MT> not <MT>fat</MT>
look for foods or supplements that contain both to reverse <MT>insulin resistance</MT>

<MT>diabetes</MT> it is <MT>metabolic disorder</MT> in which the person has <MT>high blood glucose level</MT> because of <MT>insulin</MT> production is inadequate or the body cell do not respond to <MT>insulin</MT>
<MT>diabetes</MT> is long term condition
<MT>insulin</MT> <MT>insulin</MT> is produced by <MT>beta cells of the pancreas</MT>
<MT>insulin</MT> regulates the <MT>metabolism</MT> of <MT>carbohydrates</MT> <MT>fats</MT> and protein
it promotes absorption of <MT>glucose</MT> from the <MT>blood</MT> into <MT>fat liver</MT> and <MT>skeletal muscle cells</MT> which converted into <MT>glycogen</MT>

excessive thrust accompanied by <MT>excessive dryness of mouth</MT>
in <MT>diabetes</MT> kidney loses the ability to pull out <MT>glucose</MT> from the water
hence osmotic pressure creates which causes thrust
it is pressure that builds up between liquid with high concentration of solute and liquid
weight loss in <MT>diabetic patient</MT> <MT>insulin hormone</MT> is not getting <MT>glucose</MT>
body starts <MT>burning of fat</MT> and <MT>muscle cell</MT> as source of fuel which causes weight loss
hunger increases appetite
when we eat food the body
in diabetic person <MT>glucose from blood</MT> cannot enter into the body cells due to lack of <MT>insulin</MT> or <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
lack of energy body

click here type <MT>diabetes</MT> is <MT>chronic disease</MT> characterized by <MT>abnormal glucose metabolism</MT> 
type <MT>diabetes</MT> is by far the most common form of <MT>diabetics</MT> actually suffer from this form of the <MT>disease</MT> 
in the case of type <MT>diabetes</MT> there is <MT>resistance of the tissues</MT> to <MT>insulin</MT> and decreased response to <MT>glucose</MT> by the <MT>pancreas</MT> 
the circulating endogenous <MT>insulin</MT> is sufficient to prevent <MT>ketosis</MT> 
there is often excessive <MT>insulin secretion</MT> and excessive activity of the <MT>beta cells</MT> in the <MT>pancreas</MT> 
<MT>diabetes</MT> is very <MT>widespread metabolic disorder</MT> 
studies have estimated that in there were million people <MT>infected</MT> with the <MT>disease</MT> worldwide and according to several estimations the number will reach million by this is chronic condition that may remain silent for long periods and the <MT>progression of the disease</MT> is highly unpredictable 
the most important step you can take to treat <MT>diabetes</MT> naturally without drugs lose weight <MT>obesity</MT> is taking epidemic proportions in many countries 
<MT>abdominal obesity</MT> is even more dangerous and is an important and independent risk factor for the occurrence of <MT>hyperlipidemia</MT> <MT>hypertension</MT> <MT>cardiovascular disease</MT> and <MT>diabetes</MT> especially type this happens because <MT>visceral fat</MT> is not an inert <MT>tissue</MT> but is actually an <MT>endocrine organ</MT> that produces many <MT>hormones</MT> that regulate the <MT>energy homeostasis</MT> of the body and affects the <MT>secretion of insulin</MT> that can cause <MT><MT>inflammation</MT> in the blood vessels</MT> 
<MT>visceral fat</MT> may cause <MT>weight gain high</MT> levels of <MT>fasting glucose</MT> and <MT>insulin resistance</MT> 
safe indicator of <MT>abdominal obesity</MT> is the measurement of waist circumference 
waist circumference should be under cm for men and under cm for women 
in conclusion increased levels of <MT>visceral fat</MT> is major risk factor for developing type <MT>diabetes</MT> and should be addressed by any <MT>diabetic patient</MT> that wishes to treat the <MT>disease</MT> 
what is more it has been shown that loss of of your total body weight can represents <MT>loss of visceral fat</MT> by about which improves the function of the <MT>adipose tissue</MT> 
make sure you lose weight gradually and try to adopt healthy eating habits to ensure lasting results 
what you need to do measure your waistline 
as mentioned above the limit is cm for women and cm for men 
the larger the circumference of your waist the greater risk to become <MT>diabetic</MT> 
if you already suffer with this condition then large waist circumference may compromise <MT>glycemic</MT> control since it reduces the body ability to handle <MT>glucose</MT> while increasing <MT>insulin resistance</MT> 
regularly check the <MT>levels of lipids</MT> and <MT>glucose in the blood</MT> 
now pay close attention here to control type <MT>diabetes</MT> there is an amazing method that can help you reverse the <MT>disease</MT> the natural way 
<MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is probably the most serious medical condition that you haven heard about yet 
so what is <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> why is it so serious and why haven you heard about it 
here is what you need to know 
the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is cluster of the most dangerous <MT>heart attack</MT> risk factors <MT>raised blood glucose central adiposity</MT> often called beer belly abnormal <MT>cholesterol levels</MT> abnormal <MT>blood fats</MT> also called <MT>triglycerides</MT> and <MT>high blood pressure</MT> 
it is estimated that in adults have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and the condition becomes more common as we get older so that by the age of nearly third of adults have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> 
so why is <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> so important 
well if you have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> you are much more likely to suffer <MT>heart attack</MT> or stroke more likely to develop full <MT>blown diabetes</MT> more likely to develop cancer and more likely to develop <MT>alzheimer disease</MT> 
all of these conditions are serious and they are getting far more common 
<MT>dementia</MT> and <MT>alzheimer disease</MT> have overtaken cancer and <MT>heart disease</MT> as the leading cause of death in england and wales in and the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and <MT>diabetes</MT> are thought to be important risk factors for these conditions 
so how can you check to see if you have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> 
well first of all get out tape measure 
if you are man and your waist circumference is more than cm or if you are woman and your waist is more than cm you have one of the main features of <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> 
if in addition you have any of the following you will be classified as having <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> <MT>raised blood triglycerides</MT> <MT>reduced hdl cholesterol</MT> sometimes known as good <MT>cholesterol</MT> <MT>raised blood pressure</MT> or <MT>raised fasting plasma glucose</MT> 
note if you are man of south asian or indian heritage the important threshold for waist circumference is cm 
<MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> has not yet been classified as <MT>disease</MT> it is still regarded as collection of signs and symptoms which together are serious risk factors for our most deadly and disabling medical conditions 
several medical organisations such as the world health organisation who the independent <MT>diabetes</MT> federation idf and the european group for the study of <MT>insulin resistance</MT> egir define the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> in very slightly different ways and this adds even more to the confusion about what exactly <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is 
however many experts now believe that the underlying problem in <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is <MT>insulin resistance</MT> 
<MT>insulin resistance</MT> develops when this <MT>hormone</MT> cannot work properly when <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> are abnormally high and still relatively ineffective in keeping <MT>blood glucose levels</MT> regulated properly 
metabolic specialists now use the term <MT>insulin resistance syndrome</MT> instead of <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> 
<MT>insulin</MT> is <MT>hormone</MT> produced by the <MT>pancreas</MT> and it is important in the <MT>metabolism</MT> of <MT>carbohydrates</MT> and <MT>fats</MT> 
when sugar and <MT>carbohydrates</MT> are eaten <MT>insulin</MT> promotes the uptake of <MT>glucose</MT> from the <MT>blood</MT> into <MT>muscles</MT> and <MT>fat cells</MT> 
hence it is often said that <MT>insulin</MT> allows cells to use <MT>glucose</MT> for energy and also to store excess <MT>glucose</MT> and sugar as <MT>glycogen</MT> and <MT>fat</MT>
when <MT>blood glucose levels</MT> fall stored <MT>glucose</MT> is released for energy from the breakdown of <MT>glycogen</MT> stores in the <MT>liver</MT> and in the <MT>muscles</MT> 
in the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> <MT>insulin levels</MT> are chronically high 
fasting <MT>blood levels of insulin</MT> in the morning are often abnormally high and <MT>insulin levels</MT> rise to very high levels when food is eaten
continuously <MT>high levels of insulin</MT> cause the <MT>liver cells</MT> to store <MT>fat</MT> resulting in <MT>fatty liver</MT> which cannot function normally 
as the <MT>insulin resistance</MT> worsens the <MT>pancreas</MT> may not be able to produce enough <MT>insulin</MT> in response to food and then <MT>glucose levels in the blood</MT> rise above the threshold for the patient to be called <MT>diabetic</MT> 
so why haven you heard of <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> 
well until quite recently the connection between <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and host of <MT>chronic diseases</MT> was not fully understood 
we now know that <MT>insulin resistance</MT> is the key 
until recently it was difficult to measure <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> but the technology has improved and we can now measure <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> accurately and we have good tests to diagnose <MT>insulin resistance</MT> as well as good strategies to reverse <MT>insulin resistance</MT> and the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> 
once you can measure <MT>insulin resistance</MT> you are well on your way to fixing it and monitoring improvement with interventions

what is <MT>diabetes</MT> 
<MT>insulin</MT> is <MT>hormone</MT> secreted in <MT>beta cells of the pancreas</MT> which helps to decrease the <MT>level of glucose</MT> in our blood 
<MT>chromium</MT> is important for normal function of <MT>insulin</MT> and broccoli enriched in <MT>chromium</MT> 
<MT>diabetes</MT> is classified into type type and type or <MT>gestational diabetes</MT> 
<MT>gestational diabetes</MT> type occurs only during pregnancy 
if <MT>pancreas</MT> does not produce <MT>insulin</MT> is called type <MT>diabetes</MT>
similarly if <MT>pancreas</MT> producing very low amount of <MT>insulin</MT> is called type <MT>diabetes</MT> 
<MT>diabetes</MT> may cause <MT>cardiovascular disease</MT> 
type <MT>diabetes</MT> is also known as <MT>juvenile diabetes</MT> type <MT>diabetes</MT> is common <MT>disease</MT> in children 
men who are living with low testosterone level have <MT>diabetes</MT> risk 
in order to prevent <MT>diabetes insulin</MT> helps to decrease <MT>glucose level</MT> 
similarly <MT>insulin</MT> can also help to decrease hungry and increase <MT>dopamine neurotransmitter level</MT> 
<MT>diabetic retinopathy</MT> is an <MT>eye disease</MT> caused by <MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> 
sometimes <MT>diabetes retinopathy</MT> may leads to blindness 
in globally core people had <MT>diabetes</MT> 
recently researchers identified that the eating <MT>potassium</MT> rich foods like white beans potato banana etc helps to prevent <MT>diabetes</MT> patients from <MT>renal failure</MT> 
th november of every year is the world <MT>diabetes</MT> awareness day 
what are the <MT>symptoms of diabetes</MT> 
the both <MT>diabetes insipidus</MT> and <MT>mellitus</MT> have same symptoms but they are exactly different from each other 
important symptoms of <MT>diabetes</MT> are listed below 
<MT>polydipsia</MT> it means excessive thirst caused by our body in order to minimize <MT>glucose concentration</MT> in our <MT>blood</MT> 
not to be confused with psycogenic <MT>polydipsia primary</MT> <MT>polydipsia</MT> which is an excessive thirst caused by mental stress 
<MT>polyurea</MT> it means frequent urine output due to <MT>polydipsia</MT> 
frequent <MT>masturbation</MT> does not cause <MT>polyurea</MT> <MT>polyphagia</MT> it means frequent hungry 
how to diagnose <MT>diabetes</MT> 
there are several types of test helps to diagnose <MT>diabetes</MT> 
benedict solution test is the simple <MT>urine test</MT> which helps to diagnose <MT>diabetes</MT> for our self in home 
<MT>fast sugar test</MT> fst also helps to diagnose <MT>diabetes</MT> 
<MT>glucometer</MT> is an advanced device which helps to diagnose <MT>diabetes</MT> within few seconds 
how to treat <MT>diabetes</MT> 
<MT>sitagliptin</MT> januvia lantus generic name <MT>linsulin glargine</MT> and <MT>metformin</MT> brand name metafort are the name of the drugs helps to treat <MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> 
but these drugs must not be use without doctor advice 
<MT>insulin injection</MT> also helps to reduce <MT>blood sugar level</MT> and fasting helps to reduce our sugar 
broccoli is the best nutrition food for patients who living with <MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> 
consuming large amount of water helps to push out <MT>blood glucose</MT> via <MT>urine</MT>

pimple called <MT>lipoma</MT> the removal 
in this video have explained briefly about three types of <MT>adipose tissues</MT> <MT>white adipose tissue</MT> <MT>brown adipose tissue</MT> and <MT>biege adipose tissue</MT> 
the <MT>brown adipose tissue</MT> is abundantly seen in neonates and the quantity of it decreases as neonate develops into infant child adolescent and adult 
<MT>brown adipose tissue</MT> has more <MT>mitochondria</MT> with high expression of an <MT>uncoupler protein</MT> called <MT>thermogenin</MT> 
<MT>thermogenin</MT> is also referred as <MT>uncouplin protein</MT> <MT>ucp</MT> 
<MT>thermogenin</MT> acts as uncoupler of electron transport chain and uncouple oxidation from <MT>phosphorylation<MT> in electron transport chain 
this way <MT>thermogenin</MT> in <MT>brown adipose tissue</MT> decreases the efficiency of electron transport chain thereby decreasing effective <MT>atp</MT> generation from substrate oxidation 
watch my video on electron transport chain in the link below 
this patient came with the complaint of <MT>swelling</MT> on <MT>thigh</MT> 
it was diagnosed as <MT>lipoma</MT> 
the large mass was excised 
there are many different ways to classify <MT>fat</MT> saturated trans unsaturated brown white and <MT>essential fatty acids</MT> 
some are essential for life and some are <MT>lethal</MT> 
where <MT>fat</MT> accumulates is also important 
if white <MT>fat</MT> accumulates inside the <MT>abdominal cavity</MT> it predisposes to the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and type two <MT>diabetes with all of its complications</MT> 
however if it accumulates in other places it actually extends life expectancy 
<MT>brown fat</MT> accumulates in the neck in humans 
contrary to <MT>white fat</MT> which stores <MT>fat</MT> and makes us overweight <MT>brown fat</MT> burns <MT>fat</MT> when the body is exposed to cold and is associated with lower body weight 
wouldn it be wonderful if we could convert <MT>white fat</MT> to <MT>brown fat</MT> so we tend to burn it and weight less 
maybe not 
so far drugs that do this have been <MT>lethal</MT> 
find it very interesting that we re always looking for ways to subvert the way nature operates rather than live healthy lifestyle 
it is also interesting that <MT>fat</MT> is <MT>highly active tissue metabolically</MT> 
in general we have <MT>fat</MT> <MT>phobia</MT> in this country that is off target 
<MT>fat</MT> is healthy food and what our body burns for fuel most of the time

<MT>lipoma</MT> is <MT>benign tumor</MT> under the skin composed of <MT>adipose tissue</MT> which is the most common form of <MT>soft tissue tumor</MT> 
<MT>fat tissue</MT> also is known as <MT>adipose tissue</MT> or <MT>lipoma</MT> 
but most people call it ball of <MT>fat</MT> under the skin 
it is not life threatening condition and is usually painless but it can become very unpleasant and is not pretty to look at 
<MT>lipomas</MT> can appear on any body part but usually affect the hands neck <MT>forehead</MT> <MT>torso</MT> and <MT>armpits</MT> 
the usual removal procedure involves surgery but you should know that the problem can also be treated naturally 
if you want to go through <MT>surgical procedure</MT> you might get these <MT>complications due to infections</MT> and the post <MT>surgical pain</MT> 
you will actually have wound after it and the pain might continue for days 
that why if you have <MT>lipoma</MT> you should treat it naturally and not put yourself under any kind of risk 
today we re going to show you few great recipes that are efficient and can eliminate the <MT>fat tissue</MT> in just few days 
for the preparation of these recipes you will need simple ingredients that are cheap and easily available 
watch this video to learn best home remedies to get rid of <MT>lipomas</MT> it home

in <MT>biology adipose tissue</MT> po or <MT>body fat</MT> or just <MT>fat</MT> is <MT>loose connective tissue</MT> composed mostly of <MT>adipocytes</MT> 
in addition to <MT>adipocytes</MT> <MT>adipose tissue</MT> contains the <MT>stromal vascular fraction svf of cells</MT> including <MT>preadipocytes</MT> <MT>fibroblasts</MT> <MT>vascular endothelial cells</MT> and variety of <MT>immune cells</MT> 
<MT>adipose tissue</MT> <MT>macrophages</MT> atms 
<MT>adipose tissue</MT> is derived from <MT>preadipocytes</MT> 
its main role is to store energy in the form of <MT>lipids</MT> although it also cushions and insulates the body 
far from <MT>hormonally inert adipose tissue</MT> has in recent years been recognized as major <MT>endocrine organ</MT> as it produces <MT>hormones</MT> such as <MT>leptin estrogen resistin</MT> and the <MT>cytokine</MT> tnf 
moreover <MT>adipose tissue</MT> can affect other <MT>organ systems of the body</MT> and may lead to <MT>disease</MT> 
<MT>obesity</MT> or being overweight in humans and most animals does not depend on body weight but on the amount of <MT>body fat</MT> to be specific <MT>adipose tissue</MT> 
the two types of <MT>adipose tissue</MT> are <MT>white adipose tissue</MT> wat and <MT>brown adipose tissue</MT> bat

hope this information will helpful to get idea in brief about this 
the color comes from the large number of <MT>mitochondria<MT> in the cells which is where the heat is generated via uncoupling protein ucp 
<MT>white adipose tissue</MT> is what we more commonly call <MT>fat tissue<MT> its primary function is to store energy in the chemical form of <MT>long chain fats</MT> <MT>adipose tissue</MT> more specifically <MT>brown adipose tissue</MT> was first identified by the to regions of <MT>white adipose tissue</MT> which are found under the skin between the differences have been observed in comparing eat with <MT>subcutaneous fat</MT> below information will help you to get some more though about the subject <MT>white adipocytes</MT> <MT>white fat cells</MT> have <MT>single lipid droplet brown</MT> from what we can tell so far main differences between the two are white brown and <MT>white adipose tissues</MT> intrinsic differences in <MT>gene</MT> important differences exist between <MT>subcutaneous</MT> and <MT>visceral</MT> depots which <MT>mitochondria</MT> are functionally specialized in different <MT>tissues</MT> and detailed understanding of this specialization is important to elucidate anyway if you want for more info you would better continue reading 
our posts on research being done at joslin <MT>diabetes</MT> center on <MT>brown fat</MT> prompted anumber of our readers to send in questions on this subject the <MT>brown fat cells</MT> specialized in the production of heat burns <MT>fats</MT> and sugars 
the <MT>brown fat cells</MT> specialized in the production of heat burns <MT>energy calories</MT> what is the difference between white brown and <MT>beige fat</MT> and could some types there are two main types of <MT>adipose tissue</MT> or <MT>fat</MT> found in mammals white differences between brown and <MT>beige adipocytes</MT> 
figure differences why new <MT>white fat cells</MT> develop during cold exposure is unclear 
it is also surprising our two main types of fat brown and white play different roles

non shivering <MT>thermogenesis</MT> occurs in brown <MT>adipose tissue</MT> brown <MT>fat</MT> that is present in all eutherians swine being the only exception currently known brown <MT>adipose tissue</MT> has unique protein thermogenin or ucp that allows the uncoupling of <MT>protons</MT> moving down their <MT>mitochondrial gradient</MT> from the <MT>synthesis of atp</MT> thus allowing the energy to be dissipated as heat 
in this process substances such as <MT>free fatty acids</MT> derived from <MT>triacylglycerols</MT> remove <MT>purine</MT> <MT>adp</MT> <MT>gdp</MT> and others inhibition of <MT>thermogenin</MT> uncoupling protein which causes an influx of into the matrix of the <MT>mitochondrion</MT> and bypasses the <MT>atp synthase channel</MT> 
this uncouples <MT>oxidative phosphorylation</MT> and the energy from the <MT>proton</MT> motive force is dissipated as heat rather than producing <MT>atp</MT> from <MT>adp</MT> which would store chemical energy for the body use 
<MT>thermogenesis</MT> can also be produced by leakage of the <MT>sodium potassium pump</MT> and the <MT>ca pump</MT> 
<MT>thermogenesis</MT> is contributioned to by futile cycles such as the simultaneous occurrence of <MT>lipogenesis</MT> and <MT>lipolysis</MT> or <MT>glycolysis</MT> and <MT>gluconeogenesis</MT> 
the low demands of <MT>thermogenesis</MT> mean that <MT>free fatty acids</MT> draw for the most part on <MT>lipolysis</MT> as the method of energy production

think of <MT>insulin</MT> as picking up sugar out of the <MT>blood</MT> and putting it into the <MT>muscles</MT> and <MT>brain</MT> to be burnt for energy 
what happens in type <MT>diabetes</MT> is the <MT>muscles</MT> become <MT>insulin resistant</MT>
the <MT>pancreas</MT> sees sugar in the <MT>bloodstream</MT> makes an <MT>insulin</MT> and the <MT>insulin</MT> picks up the sugar and tries to put it into the <MT>muscle</MT> but the <MT>muscle</MT> is <MT>resistant</MT> it wont let the sugar in 
now the <MT>pancreas</MT> in order to keep the <MT>blood sugar</MT> normal releases second <MT>insulin</MT> and the <MT>insulins</MT> are able to overcome the <MT>resistance of the muscle</MT> 
over time and with weight gain the <MT>muscles</MT> become more <MT>resistant</MT> and <MT>insulins</MT> are made to do the job then and so on 
the <MT>pancreas</MT> works harder and harder until eventually it cannot keep up and the sugar begins to get trapped in the <MT>blood</MT> and only then does the <MT>blood sugar</MT> start to rise above normal 
the time from the onset of <MT>insulin resistance</MT> to the point where the system is completely broken and diagnosis of <MT>diabetes</MT> is made can take up to years 
although there is problem one is not officially diagnosed as diabetic until their fasting sugar is above their <MT>hemoglobin</MT> is above meaning their sugar on average is points above normal or random or hour <MT>glucose test</MT> is above think of <MT>diabetes</MT> as year walk closer and closer to falling off cliff 
the day you are told you are <MT>diabetic</MT> is when you fell off the cliff 
the day before you were teatering at the edge so the actual diagnosis has been years in the making 
the good news is that with diet exercise and medications you can actually begin to walk away from the cliff 
one of the problems with <MT>insulin</MT> reasistance and type <MT>diabetes</MT> is that you have <MT>high insulin levels</MT> all the time 
<MT>insulin</MT> makes you hungry and it promotes <MT>fat</MT> storage 
when you drink alcohol your body inappropriately releases extra <MT>insulin</MT> 
this is what call the white castle effect
after night of drinking and lots of calories injested already you find yourself starving at am and looking for food 
type <MT>diabetic</MT> literally is living their life like it am and they are in search of white castle 
ironically the more <MT>diabetic</MT> you are the higher your <MT>insulin levels</MT> the higher your <MT>insulin</MT> the hungrier you are the hungrier you are the more you eat the more you eat the higher your <MT>blood sugar</MT> the higher your <MT>blood sugar</MT> the more <MT>insulin</MT> you produce and the viscious cycle revolves 
the good news is starting medications even as <MT>pre diabetic</MT> can help to reverse the cycle and help you lose weight and become less of <MT>diabetic</MT> 
you can walk away from the cliff 
you need to find doctor that is proactive 
you need to look for clues that indicate you are heading for the cliff 
<MT>high triglycerides</MT> <MT>low hdl cholesterol</MT> fasting <MT>glucose<MT> between or belly greater than for woman or for man can all be indicators of <MT>pre diabetes</MT> 
you can ask your doctor to test fasting <MT>insulin level</MT> or <MT>peptide</MT> 
even better have them order hour <MT>glucose tolerance test</MT> with fasting and hour <MT>insulin level</MT>

<MT>latent autoimmune diabetes of adults</MT> often also late onset autoimmune <MT>diabetes of adulthood<MT> or aging slow onset type <MT>diabetes</MT> or <MT>diabetes</MT> type is form of <MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> type that occurs in adults often with slower course of onset 
adults with lada may initially be diagnosed as having type <MT>diabetes</MT> based on their age particularly if they have risk factors for type <MT>diabetes</MT> such as strong family history or <MT>obesity</MT> 
the diagnosis is based on the finding of <MT>high blood sugar</MT> together with the clinical impression that <MT>islet</MT> failure rather than <MT>insulin resistance</MT> is the main cause <MT>detection of low peptide</MT> and raised <MT>antibodies</MT> against the <MT>islets</MT> of langerhans support the diagnosis 
it can only be treated with the usual oral treatments for type <MT>diabetes</MT> for certain period of time after which <MT>insulin</MT> treatment is usually necessary as well as long term monitoring for complications

born in the us poet laureate donald hall has published essays and anthologies of both poetry and prose including string too short to be saved recollections of summers on new england farm and ox cart man children book which won the caldecott medal 
listener kendel currier transcript well we came here and we published books in the same year her first book of poems and my book called kicking the leaves and our second books came out the same year 
we always swore we wouldn come out the same year so we wouldn be reviewed together but we always did more or less 
it was it was maybe think it was when her second book which was kind of breakthrough the boat of quiet hours came out at the same time as book of mine called the happy man 
and the happy man the title of it took from some note by tolstoy in which he talked about the happy man and all happiness and he full of thoughts of suicide and it book with lot of depressing poems in but not entirely 
when told jane ve found title ve found title going to call it the happy man 
typical of jane she said it sounds too depressed 
and but anyway did call it the happy man 
but at there was at this time in my life as writer there was sort of physical and psychological element than the writing that have talked about in print and that is that when was about something like that became an adult onset diabetic and my <MT>diabetes</MT> is still with me and it very much under control and so on but it had the effect gradually in my of making it impossible for me to sustain an erection 
and this was depressing it was depressing for both of us of course and my poems suddenly turned kind of old and resigned and it was not was not in any deep depression but it was difficult for both of us and my poetry became sort of more passive or old and so on 
and think some of the poems are good that are in this mode but finally solved the problem by having <MT>penile implant surgery</MT> and potency came back
was always always <MT>orgasmic</MT> but just couldn have an erection but got permanent one and it was wonderful and jane adored it and said kept saying perkins what you did for me and would point out it wasn just for her but at that same time my poems got back their liveliness and energy just because of bit of surgery but it very noticeable 
and it was noticeable in what lot of people think is the best thing ever did which was the book length poem 
to your health body and spirit reversing type <MT>diabetes</MT> through fasting type <MT>diabetes</MT> sometimes referred to as <MT>adult onset diabetes</MT> doesn have to be permanent 
fasting and calorie restriction can help you get <MT>control of your blood sugar</MT> lower your <MT>blood pressure</MT> and even help reverse type <MT>diabetes</MT> 
but before we get into how fasting can undo the damage of type <MT>diabetes</MT> we first need to understand how type <MT>diabetes</MT> affects the body 
how does type <MT>diabetes</MT> develop 
<MT>diabetes</MT> develops when <MT>fat</MT> accumulates in areas of the body that shouldn accumulate <MT>fat</MT> 
it all starts with an abundance of <MT>fat</MT> in your <MT>muscle tissue</MT> 
typically this is caused by family history poor diet or sedentary lifestyle 
this <MT>fat</MT> is called <MT>intramuscular fat</MT> 
it like the marbling on steak only it inside your <MT>muscles</MT> and it causes <MT>insulin resistance</MT> the characteristic that distinguishes type <MT>diabetes</MT> from type even worse intramuscular <MT>fat</MT> causes <MT>muscles</MT> to produce <MT>toxic fat metabolites</MT> like <MT>ceramide</MT> and <MT>diacylglycerol</MT> dag 
these <MT>toxins</MT> also contribute to <MT>insulin resistance</MT> <MT>high insulin levels</MT>lead to <MT>fatty liver</MT> when <MT>blood sugar</MT> is high the <MT>pancreas</MT> produces <MT>insulin</MT> to <MT>lower blood sugar</MT> 
however <MT>insulin resistance</MT> causes the <MT>liver</MT> to stop responding to <MT>insulin</MT> 
in fact the <MT>liver</MT> keeps producing sugar despite <MT>high level of sugar</MT> in the <MT>blood</MT> 
consuming food that high in sugar is like throwing gas on the fire and the abundance of sugar is converted to <MT>fat</MT> and stored in the <MT>liver</MT>

simon was diagnosed with <MT>late onset type diabetes</MT> when he was years old 
his motivation to really address his diet was weight gain but the result he now 
the idea of completely reversing <MT>diabetes</MT> has been questioned time and time again 
in order to determine the answer to this question you must take into account few factors such as what type of <MT>diabetes</MT> are you dealing with and whether or not your body is producing <MT>insulin</MT> 
typically doctors refer to <MT>diabetes</MT> reversal when you are able to go off your medication while engaging in healthy lifestyle program 
obviously when you are not taking medication for <MT>diabetes</MT> and your <MT>blood sugar</MT> is under control you do not have <MT>diabetes</MT> or you have reversed <MT>diabetes</MT> 
but the important message here is that you have to keep healthy lifestyle program 
if you fall off the wagon and start eating the wrong stuff again and stop exercising you will end up with <MT>diabetes</MT> yet again 
so to answer the question can type <MT>adult onset diabetes</MT> be reversed the answer is yes 
can it be reversed with diet and exercise 
absolutely yes

little girl in texas had diet so unhealthy that she <MT>developed type diabetes</MT> before her fourth birthday doctor who treated her says 
the <MT>obese</MT> year old was diagnosed with what used to be known as <MT>adult onset diabetes</MT> which has become lot more common among children over the last few decades reports reuters 
in press release dr michael yafi pediatric endocrinologist at the university of texas says the pound toddler brought to his clinic had symptoms of <MT>excessive urination</MT> and thirst but her medical history was unremarkable and there was no <MT>family history of diabetes</MT> 
review of her diet however revealed poor family nutritional habits with uncontrolled counting of calories and <MT>fat</MT> yafi says 
the doctor who will present his research at global <MT>diabetes</MT> conference this week tells reuters that he has never encountered type <MT>diabetes</MT> patient so young before though he suspects there are more out there and he now screens all <MT>obese</MT> children for the condition 
luckily he was able to reverse the condition in the texas girl after catching it so early with the use of the <MT>diabetes</MT> <MT>drug metformin</MT> along with smaller portions of food and increased physical activity the girl lost weight her <MT>blood glucose levels</MT> returned to normal and she no longer had <MT>diabetes</MT> after six months the guardian reports

the digital millennium copyright act extends this definition for further uses cells develop from <MT>hematopoietic stem cells</MT> hscs that originate from <MT>bone marrow</MT> 
<MT>hscs</MT> first differentiate into <MT>multipotent progenitor mpp cells</MT> then common <MT>lymphoid progenitor clp cells</MT> 
from here their development into cells occurs in several stages shown in image to the right each marked by various <MT>gene expression</MT> patterns and <MT>immunoglobulin chain</MT> and <MT>chain gene</MT> loci arrangements the latter due to cells undergoing recombination as they develop 
cells undergo two types of selection while developing in the <MT>bone marrow</MT> to ensure proper development 
positive selection occurs through <MT>antigen</MT> independent signaling involving both the pre bcr and the <MT>bcr</MT> 
if these receptors do not bind to their <MT>ligand cells</MT> do not receive the proper signals and cease to develop 
negative selection occurs through the binding of <MT>self antigen</MT> with the <MT>bcr</MT> if the <MT>bcr</MT> can bind strongly to <MT>self antigen</MT> then the cell undergoes one of four fates clonal deletion receptor editing anergy or ignorance cell ignores signal and continues development 
this negative selection process leads to state of central tolerance in which the mature cells don bind with <MT>self antigens</MT> present in the <MT>bone marrow</MT> 
to complete development into <MT>mature cells</MT> <MT>immature cells</MT> migrate from the <MT>bone marrow</MT> to the <MT>spleen</MT> as well as pass through two transitional stages and throughout their <MT>migration</MT> to the <MT>spleen</MT> and after <MT>spleen</MT> entry they are considered cells 
within the <MT>spleen cells</MT> transition to cells 
cells differentiate into either follicular fo cells or <MT>marginal zone</MT> <MT>mz cells</MT> depending on signals received through the <MT>bcr</MT> and other receptors 
once differentiated they are now considered <MT>mature cells</MT> or <MT>naive cells</MT>

<MT>hyper igm</MT> this is xlr disorder of your cd this leads to an inability to class switch 
therefore your default <MT>igm</MT> will increase 
wiskott aldrich this is due to mutation in <MT>wasp</MT> gene which helps regulate the <MT>cytoskeleton</MT> and receptors

for more information log on to cell recognition of <MT>antigen</MT> is not the only element necessary for <MT>cell activation combination of clonal proliferation</MT> and terminal differentiation into <MT>plasma cells</MT> 
cells can be activated in cell dependent or independent manner 
<MT>cell dependent activation</MT> once <MT>pathogen</MT> is ingested by an <MT>antigen presenting cell</MT> such as macrophage or <MT>dendritic cell</MT> the <MT>pathogen proteins</MT> are then digested to <MT>peptides</MT> and attached to <MT>class ii mhc protein</MT> 
this complex is then moved to the outside of the <MT>cell membrane</MT> 
the macrophage is now activated to deliver multiple signals to <MT>specific cell</MT> that recognizes the <MT>peptide</MT> presented 
the cell is then stimulated to produce autocrines resulting in the <MT>proliferation</MT> or differentiation to effector or <MT>memory cells</MT> 
<MT>helper cells</MT> 
<MT>cd cells</MT> then activate specific cells through phenomenon known as an <MT>immunological synapse</MT> 
<MT>activated cells</MT> subsequently produce <MT>antibodies</MT> which assist in <MT>inhibiting pathogens</MT> until <MT>phagocytes</MT> 
<MT>macrophages</MT> <MT>neutrophils</MT> or the <MT>complement system</MT> for example clears the host of the <MT>pathogen</MT> 
most <MT>antigens</MT> are dependent meaning cell help is required for maximal <MT>antibody production</MT> 
with dependent <MT>antigen</MT> the first signal comes from <MT>antigen</MT> cross linking the cell receptor <MT>bcr</MT> and the second signal comes from co stimulation provided by cell 
dependent <MT>antigens</MT> contain proteins that are presented on cell class ii mhc to special subtype of cell called <MT>th cell</MT> 
when cell processes and presents the same <MT>antigen</MT> to the primed th cell the cell secretes <MT>cytokines</MT> that activate the cell 
these <MT>cytokines</MT> trigger <MT>cell proliferation</MT> and differentiation into <MT>plasma cells</MT> 
isotype switching to <MT>igg</MT> <MT>iga</MT> and <MT>ige</MT> and <MT>memory cell</MT> generation occur in response to <MT>dependent antigens</MT> 
this isotype switching is known as class switch recombination csr 
once this switch has occurred that particular cell will usually no longer make the earlier isotypes <MT>igm</MT> or <MT>igd</MT> 
cells undergo two types of selection while developing in the <MT>bone marrow<MT> to ensure proper development 
positive selection occurs through <MT>antigen</MT> independent signaling involving both the <MT>pre bcr</MT> and the <MT>bcr</MT> 
if these receptors do not bind to their <MT>ligand</MT> cells do not receive the proper signals and cease to develop

genome wide association studies gwas have identified more than loci associated with genetic risk of type <MT>diabetes</MT> 
several candidate genes have been suggested or identified within these regions but the <MT>molecular mechanisms</MT> by which they contribute to <MT>insulitis</MT> and <MT>eta cell</MT> destruction remain to be clarified 
more than of the candidate genes are expressed in <MT>human pancreatic islets</MT> suggesting that they contribute to by regulating at least in part pathogenic mechanisms at the <MT>eta cell level</MT> 
recent studies by our group indicate that important genetically regulated pathways in <MT>eta</MT> cells include <MT>innate immunity</MT> and <MT>antiviral</MT> activity involving rig like receptors particularly mda and regulators of type ifns 
ptpn usp and tyk and <MT>genes</MT> related to <MT>eta cell phenotype</MT> and susceptibility to pro apoptotic stimuli

these observations reinforce the concept that the early pathogenesis of is characterized by dialog between the <MT>immune system</MT> and <MT>pancreatic</MT> <MT>eta cells</MT> 
this dialog is probably influenced by <MT>polymorphisms in genes</MT> expressed at the <MT>eta cell</MT> and or <MT>immune system level</MT> leading to inadequate responses to environmental cues such as <MT>viral infections</MT> 
our ongoing work <MT>aims</MT> to clarify how these <MT>disease</MT> associated variants affect <MT>pancreatic eta cell</MT> responses to <MT>inflammation</MT> and the subsequent triggering of <MT>autoimmune responses</MT> and the specific and progressive <MT>eta cell</MT> loss by apoptosis

hi welcome to our youtube channel 
here we are going to tell you about various causes of <MT>diabetes</MT> 
in this video we will tell you all the causes related to <MT>diabetes</MT> 
after the age of the population of <MT>islet cells</MT> is established and not plastic in man after age of years 
post mortem studies show that <MT>beta cell</MT> number at diagnosis of type <MT>diabetes</MT> is around percent and decreases to around after many years 
exposure of <MT>human islet</MT> to <MT>fatty acid</MT> causes an increase in intra <MT>islet fat</MT> storage and marker of apoptosis 
saturated cells contributed more in death of beta cells 
saturated <MT>lipids</MT> are harmful to <MT>beta cells</MT> 
the endocytosis of ldl can cause <MT>beta cell</MT> death as result of ros formation 
similarly prolonged elevation of circulating <MT>nefas</MT> by <MT>lipid</MT> infusion impairs <MT>pancreatic beta cell</MT> function in vivo particularly in individuals with <MT>genetic predisposition</MT> to type <MT>diabetes</MT> 
western diets rich in saturated fats cause <MT>obesity</MT> and <MT>insulin resistance</MT> and increase levels of circulating <MT>nefas</MT> 
in addition they contribute to <MT>beta cells</MT> failure in genetically predisposed individuals 
<MT>nefas</MT> cause <MT>beta cell</MT> apoptosis and may thus contribute to progressive <MT>beta cell</MT> loss in type <MT>diabetes</MT> 
type <MT>diabetes</MT> is characterized by defects in both <MT>insulin secretion</MT> and <MT>insulin action</MT> 
sfa ingestion reduced <MT>insulin sensitivity</MT> 
<MT>insulin secretion</MT> failed to compensate for <MT>insulin resistance</MT> in subjects who ingested sfa 
failure of <MT>insulin secretion</MT> to compensate for <MT>insulin resistance</MT> implies impaired <MT>beta cell function</MT> in the sfa 
increased consumption of sfas has powerful short and long term effect on <MT>insulin</MT> action 
saturated fats are harmful to <MT>insulin</MT> 
environmental factors such as diets rich in saturated fats contribute to dysfunction and death of <MT>pancreatic cells</MT> in <MT>diabetes</MT>

my name is peter thompson 
postdoctoral scholar at the ucsf <MT>diabetes</MT> center and it been about months now since we reached our funding goal with your support 
so very happy today to share you some updates 
curing type <MT>diabetes</MT> requires combination of three strategies 
the <MT>immune system</MT> needs to be reset its actions need to be regulated and <MT>beta cells</MT> need to be regenerated 
joslin is tackling this suite of problems with the <MT>rs</MT> project collaboration between three researchers studying the <MT>immune system</MT> and <MT>beta cells</MT> 
while his colleagues in the project tom serwold ph and stephan kissler ph are working to reset and regulate the <MT>immune system</MT> peng yi ph is working on regenerating lost <MT>beta cells</MT> 
he is using <MT>hormone</MT> called <MT>betatrophin</MT> secreted by the <MT>liver</MT> and he plans to create drug to stimulate production of <MT>beta cells</MT> in people with type <MT>diabetes</MT> 
dr michael german of university of california san francisco ucsf explains how research is providing new ways to improve <MT>beta cell function</MT> for people with <MT>diabetes</MT>

this <MT>syndrome</MT> can be described as failure of the <MT>pancreatic</MT> <MT>beta cell</MT> mass to secrete sufficient <MT>insulin</MT> to counteract <MT>elevated blood glucose levels</MT> 
it is largely believed that all <MT>beta cells</MT> are the same 
however recent studies have shown that <MT>beta cells</MT> in fact comprise discrete subpopulations some of which may contribute to <MT>insulin secretion</MT> and more than others 
this presentation will highlight the methodology that has allowed us to redefine how <MT>beta cells</MT> and more generally <MT>endocrine cells</MT> function 
the influence of subtle differences in the <MT>beta cell</MT> barcode on <MT>insulin</MT> release in health and <MT>disease</MT> will then be examined 
finally new techniques which may provide unprecedented insight into and drug development will be discussed 
<MT>beta cell</MT> failure is dominant 
heal your <MT>pancreas</MT> naturally with these foods the <MT>pancreas</MT> is really the life saver in all of us 
it plays very important role for your health and well being 
it produces your <MT>insulin</MT> 
if it is damaged you will not get <MT>insulin</MT> 
without <MT>insulin</MT> your <MT>glucose metabolism</MT> suffers 
your body cells cannot produce energy from food 
the <MT>pancreas</MT> plays crucial role in digestion 
when food empties from your stomach into the <MT>small intestine</MT> it mixes with <MT>digestive enzymes</MT> from the <MT>pancreas</MT> that <MT>neutralize stomach acid</MT> preventing damage to the <MT>intestine</MT> 
these <MT>enzymes</MT> are also essential for your body to reduce <MT>inflammation</MT> caused by <MT>trauma</MT> injury <MT>allergens</MT> <MT>toxins</MT> and <MT>infections</MT> 
but most importantly the <MT>pancreas</MT> produces <MT>insulin</MT> which reduces <MT>blood sugar levels</MT> and allows your body to store food energy for future use 
eating the right foods can heal and nourish your <MT>pancreas</MT> 
foods that heal the <MT>pancreas</MT> probiotic yogurt research finds that eating servings of <MT>low fat</MT> or <MT>fat</MT> free yogurt that contains active cultures to help ease digestion protect the <MT>pancreas</MT> and <MT>digestive system</MT> and reduce the overall risk of <MT>pancreatic cancer</MT> 
cabbage regular consumption of cabbage may help protect susceptible individuals against <MT>pancreatic cancer</MT> 
cabbage is loaded with vitamin but it also contains vitamin and <MT>folate</MT> 
spinach the <MT>pancreas</MT> needs both iron and vitamin to function properly and spinach has both 
<MT>pancreas</MT> that is properly nourished will be less likely to become inflamed or to be vulnerable to the onset of cancer 
<MT>licorice licorice root</MT> is an excellent treatment for many problems with <MT>pancreas</MT> 
traditional chinese used licorice root for thousands of years 
research even shows that this common root is loaded with an <MT>anti inflammatory compound</MT> that reduces pain and <MT>swelling</MT> that is associated with <MT>pancreatitis</MT> 
cherries it really hard to eat just handful of cherries which is great news since the fruit is rich in antioxidants and <MT>perillyl alcohol</MT> or poh compound that been linked to the prevention of <MT>pancreatic cancer</MT> 
garlic this is major help for the <MT>pancreas</MT> 
garlic reduces the amount of sugar in the <MT>blood</MT> and stimulates the <MT>pancreas</MT> to produce sufficient <MT>levels of insulin</MT> 
aim to eat one to two slightly crushed cloves of garlic each day in addition to adding some to your foods 
red reishi mushrooms used in china for thousands of years to restore balance inside the body red rishi mushrooms reduce <MT>inflammation</MT> and have similar benefits of onions and garlic for <MT>pancreatic health</MT> 
if are hard to find in your local grocery store try the asian foods section at specialty grocery store 
sweet potatoes sweet potatoes along with other orange and yellow vegetables like carrots corn and squash contain nutrients which are beneficial for the <MT>pancreas</MT> and may help prevent cancer 
other foods that also heal the <MT>pancreas</MT> are blueberries broccoli red grapes and tomato vegetable soup 
because the <MT>pancreas</MT> is very easily damaged by an unhealthy diet eating these certain food will boost its health

discussion of the mechanisms of <MT>insulin resistance</MT> and <MT>beta cell</MT> failure as well as the interaction with diet 
reversal of in the context of <MT>caloric restriction</MT> <MT>gastric bypass surgery</MT> and plant based nutrition will be discussed with emphasis on the benefits of plant based diet approach 
this is review of prof hail kim lecture on <MT>diabetes</MT> and <MT>insulin</MT> 
we will review the new emerging concept of pathogenesis of type <MT>diabetes</MT> from <MT>insulin resistance to beta cell</MT> failure in this lecture 
hope it will help you next time

human <MT>endocrine system</MT> <MT>pancreas</MT> <MT>pancreas</MT> is mixed <MT>gland</MT> portion of <MT>pancreas</MT> acts like <MT>exocrine gland</MT> and another portion acts like an <MT>endocrine gland</MT> 
the <MT>cells of endocrine pancreas</MT> are called <MT>islets</MT> of langerhangs representing to of <MT>pancreatic tissue</MT> 
they secrete <MT>hormones</MT> <MT>insulin</MT> and <MT>glucagon</MT> <MT>insulin</MT> the <MT>hormone</MT> is produced by <MT>cells of islet</MT> of langerhangs 
it is <MT>peptide hormone</MT> which plays major role in the regulation of <MT>glucose homeostasis</MT> 
<MT>insulin</MT> promotes the conversion of <MT>glucose</MT> to <MT>glycogen in liver</MT> and muscle that is stored in these tissue for future use 
<MT>insulin</MT> is liberated when the <MT>blood glucose levels</MT> are high usually when food is digested and absorbed 
if sufficient <MT>insulin</MT> is not produced <MT>glucose level in blood</MT> increases and it is excreted through <MT>urine</MT> 
this is called <MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> 
<MT>diabetes</MT> is identified by the presence of <MT>sugar in urine</MT> 
<MT>diabetic patients</MT> take <MT>insulin injections</MT> regularly 
<MT>insulin</MT> also affects the <MT>metabolism of fats</MT> and proteins 
unattended diabetis results in wasting of body tissue reduced healing power <MT>ketone bodies</MT> blurred vision and <MT>kidney problems</MT> 
they may end up with <MT>gangrene</MT> and <MT>coma</MT> <MT>glucagon</MT> is <MT>peptide hormone</MT> secreted by <MT>cells of islets of langerhans</MT> 
<MT>glucagon</MT> acts on <MT>liver cells</MT> and stimulates <MT>glyconeolysis</MT> resulting in an increased <MT>blood sugar hyperglycemia</MT> 
this <MT>hormone</MT> stimulates the process of <MT>gluconeogenesis</MT> which also contributes to <MT>hyperglycemia</MT> 
<MT>glucagon</MT> reduces the <MT>cellular glucose</MT> uptake and utilization 
thus <MT>glucagon</MT> is <MT>hyperglycemic hormone</MT>

people with type <MT>diabetes</MT> may develop complications from long term use of <MT>insulin</MT> and develop <MT>hypoglycemia</MT> or severe <MT>low blood sugar</MT> 
now researchers have developed therapy that may help protect type <MT>diabetics</MT> from this life threatening condition 
alpha and <MT>beta cells</MT> are involved in healthy functioning of your <MT>pancreas</MT> and in regulating <MT>insulin levels</MT> 
based on ocr level knowledge 
here try to explain the process of <MT>insulin secretion</MT> as quickly and concisely as possible 
this is based on the ocr scheme of work and is designed to either get you started or to help you revise 
fastest explanation of <MT>beta cell function</MT> in the islets of langerhans 
this whole process takes place in the <MT>pancreas</MT> which is an interesting <MT>organ</MT> as it serves <MT>endocrine</MT> and <MT>exocrine functions</MT> 
<MT>exocrine cells</MT> secrete proteins usually <MT>enzymes</MT> into <MT>ducts</MT>

this video covers the gross <MT>structure of the pancreas</MT> including <MT>acini</MT> islets of langerhans and its constituent alpha and <MT>beta cells</MT> discussing its exocrine and <MT>endocrine functions</MT> along the way 
we ll then look at the mechanism by which <MT>insulin</MT> is released from <MT>beta cells</MT> 
<MT>insulin</MT> is the principal <MT>hormone</MT> that regulates the uptake of <MT>glucose</MT> from the <MT>blood into most cells</MT> of the body especially <MT>liver muscle</MT> and <MT>adipose tissue</MT> 
therefore deficiency of <MT>insulin</MT> or the insensitivity of its receptors plays central role in all forms of <MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> 
the body obtains <MT>glucose</MT> from three main places the intestinal absorption of food the breakdown of <MT>glycogen</MT> the storage form of <MT>glucose</MT> found in the <MT>liver</MT> and <MT>gluconeogenesis</MT> the generation of <MT>glucose</MT> from non <MT>carbohydrate</MT> substrates in the body 
<MT>insulin</MT> plays critical role in balancing <MT>glucose levels</MT> in the body 
<MT>insulin</MT> can inhibit the breakdown of <MT>glycogen</MT> or the process of <MT>gluconeogenesis</MT> it can stimulate the transport of <MT>glucose</MT> into <MT>fat</MT> and <MT>muscle cells</MT> and it can stimulate the storage of <MT>glucose</MT> in the form of <MT>glycogen</MT> 
<MT>insulin</MT> is released into the blood by <MT>beta cells</MT> cells found in the islets of langerhans in the <MT>pancreas</MT> in response to rising <MT>levels of blood glucose</MT> typically after eating 
<MT>insulin</MT> is used by about two thirds of the body cells to absorb <MT>glucose from the blood</MT> for use as fuel for conversion to other needed molecules or for storage 
lower <MT>glucose levels</MT> result in decreased <MT>insulin</MT> release from the <MT>beta cells</MT> and in the breakdown of <MT>glycogen</MT> to <MT>glucose</MT> 
this process is mainly controlled by the <MT>hormone</MT> <MT>glucagon</MT> which acts in the opposite manner to <MT>insulin</MT> 
if the amount of <MT>insulin</MT> available is insufficient if cells respond poorly to the effects of <MT>insulin</MT> <MT>insulin insensitivity</MT> or <MT>insulin resistance</MT> or if the <MT>insulin</MT> itself is defective then <MT>glucose</MT> will not be absorbed properly by the <MT>body cells</MT> that require it and it will not be stored appropriately in the <MT>liver</MT> and <MT>muscles</MT> 
the net effect is persistently <MT>high levels of blood glucose</MT> <MT>poor protein synthesis</MT> and other <MT>metabolic derangements</MT> such as <MT>acidosis</MT> 
when the <MT>glucose concentration in the blood</MT> remains high over time the <MT>kidneys</MT> will reach threshold of reabsorption and <MT>glucose</MT> will be excreted in the <MT>urine glycosuria</MT> this increases the <MT>osmotic pressure of the urine</MT> and inhibits reabsorption of water by the <MT>kidney</MT> resulting in increased <MT>urine production</MT> <MT>polyuria</MT> and increased <MT>fluid loss</MT> 
lost <MT>blood volume</MT> will be replaced osmotically from water held in body cells and other <MT>body compartments</MT> causing <MT>dehydration</MT> and increased <MT>thirst polydipsia</MT>

the <MT>pancreas</MT> the <MT>pancreas</MT> is shown here with the foreground highly magnified to reveal its inner <MT>anatomy</MT> 
ninety nine percent of <MT>pancreatic tissue</MT> is composed of <MT>acinar glands</MT> which secrete an alkaline digestive juice into the duodenum via the <MT>pancreatic duct</MT> to help digest food 
the <MT>endocrine areas of the pancreas</MT> known as the islets of langerhans are composed of two major types of cell 
the <MT>alpha cells</MT> secrete the <MT>hormone</MT> <MT>glucagon</MT> and the <MT>beta cells</MT> secrete <MT>insulin</MT> into the <MT>bloodstream</MT> 
these <MT>hormones</MT> work in opposition to control the <MT>blood glucose level</MT> 
<MT>insulin</MT> promotes the uptake and usage of <MT>glucose</MT> in the <MT>tissues</MT> particularly <MT>skeletal muscle</MT> and <MT>fat</MT> and reduces <MT>glucose production</MT> in the <MT>liver</MT> 
<MT>glucagon</MT> has an <MT>anti insulin effect</MT> in the <MT>liver</MT> increasing <MT>glucose</MT> release
the <MT>anatomy</MT> of the <MT>pancreas</MT> also includes the <MT>ampulla of the common bile duct</MT> the <MT>pancreatic duct</MT> which carries <MT>digestive juice containing enzymes</MT> to the duodenum the <MT>acini</MT> the <MT>exocrine portions of the pancreas</MT> which secrete digestive juice into the pancreas the <MT>splenic arteries</MT> which conduct oxygenated <MT>blood</MT> into the <MT>pancreas</MT> and the <MT>mesenteric veins</MT> which carry <MT>deoxygenated blood containing insulin</MT> and <MT>glucagon</MT> away from the <MT>pancreas</MT>

how <MT>pancreatic beta cells</MT> release <MT>insulin</MT> 
three important transporters on the <MT>pancreatic beta cell</MT> that participate in the regulation of <MT>insulin secretion glut</MT> <MT>glucose transporter potassium channel</MT> voltage gated calcium channel 
the <MT>glut transporter</MT> has high km value and therefore sensitive only when there high level of <MT>glucose in the blood</MT> 
when the <MT>glucose concentration</MT> in the <MT>blood</MT> is high <MT>glut transporter</MT> on the <MT>beta cells</MT> opens up and facilitated the uptake of <MT>glucose</MT> from the <MT>blood into the beta cells</MT> 
inside the <MT>beta cells glucose</MT> will undergoes <MT>glycolysis</MT> and increase the production of <MT>atp</MT> inside the <MT>beta cell</MT> 
increase level of <MT>atp</MT> inside the cell causes the <MT>potassium channel</MT> to closes 
normally the <MT>potassium channel</MT> in the <MT>beta cells pumps</MT> <MT>potassium</MT> from inside the <MT>cell out to the extracellular compartment</MT> 
because increases in <MT>atp</MT> closes the <MT>potassium pump</MT> <MT>potassium</MT> will build up inside the cell 
the build up of positive charge <MT>potassium</MT> causes the <MT>membrane</MT> to depolarize becomes less negative this depolarization opens up the <MT>voltage gated calcium channel</MT> 
once the <MT>voltage gated calcium channel</MT> opens <MT>calcium</MT> rushs into the <MT>beta cell</MT> 
increase intracellular <MT>calcium</MT> serves as second messenger to stimulate the release of <MT>insulin</MT> from the <MT>beta cell</MT> 
clinical correlation <MT>sulfonylureas</MT> mechanism of action function similar to an increase in <MT>atp</MT> within the <MT>pancreatic beta cells</MT> in causes the <MT>potassium channel</MT> to close increase <MT>intracellular potassium</MT> concentration depolarization of the <MT>plasma membrane</MT> this opens the <MT>voltage gated calcium channel</MT> increase in the <MT>influx of calcium</MT> into the cell <MT>calcium</MT> then acts as second messenger that will stimulate the release of <MT>insulin</MT> from the <MT>pancreatic beta cells</MT> 
<MT>neonatal diabetes</MT> there is mutation in the kcnj gene this gene encodes for the subunit of the <MT>potassium channel</MT> 
the mutation keeps the <MT>channel</MT> opens therefore more <MT>potassium</MT> is efflux from the cell and unable to accumulate within the <MT>beta pancreatic cells</MT> 
<MT>beta pancreatic cell</MT> does not depolarize and does not stimulate <MT>voltage gated calcium channel</MT> to open therefore it disrupt the release of <MT>insulin</MT> from <MT>pancreas</MT> 
tried my best to explain these concepts to the best of my knowledge and made it as simple as possible

<MT>insulin</MT> generally speaking <MT>insulin</MT> is designed for energy abundance 
so your body prefers to use <MT>glucose</MT> rather than <MT>fats</MT> for energy 
the body will use <MT>ch</MT> instead of <MT>fat</MT> and <MT>glycogen</MT> 
and use <MT>amino acids for protein synthesis</MT> 
<MT>glucose</MT> muscle will have increase uptake to make <MT>glycogen</MT> in the <MT>muscle</MT> 
in the <MT>liver</MT> it will be used for uptake to use for <MT>glycogen</MT> and <MT>fat</MT> 
<MT>brain</MT> will only use <MT>glucose</MT> and this is independent of <MT>insulin</MT> 
<MT>fat</MT> increase <MT>fat storage</MT> 
increase <MT>citrate</MT> and <MT>isocitrate</MT> 
increase <MT>acetylcoa carboxylase</MT> 
this increase <MT>malonyl coa</MT> which will increase <MT>fat</MT> synthesis 
this will increase <MT>lipoprotein lilpase</MT> and decrease <MT>lipase</MT> 
in deficiency you prefer <MT>fats</MT> so you increase <MT>lipoprotein lipase</MT> which increase <MT>free fatty acids</MT> 
this will become <MT>phospholipids</MT> and <MT>cholesterol</MT> leading to <MT>heart disease</MT> 
when there is <MT>free fatty acids</MT> without <MT>insulin</MT> this will increase <MT>ketone bodies</MT> <MT>acetoacetic acid</MT> and <MT>hydroxyacetate</MT> 
protein increase synthesis and storage of protein 
increase aa and increase <MT>protein synthesis</MT> 
in deficiency there is increase serum aa and increase <MT>urea in urine</MT> 
it also increase effect on <MT>growth hormone</MT> 
mechanism of action of <MT>beta cell</MT> when <MT>glucose</MT> comes in this increases <MT>atp</MT> and blocks <MT>potassium channel</MT> 
this depolarizes and causes opening of <MT>calcium channel</MT> 
regulated by <MT>glucose</MT> <MT>amino acids and git</MT> <MT>hormones</MT> 
<MT>glucagon</MT> this <MT>hormone</MT> is expressed when <MT>glucose</MT> is low 
therefore it will increase <MT>gluconeogenesis</MT> by converting <MT>amino acids</MT> into <MT>glucose</MT> and converted <MT>fats</MT> into <MT>glucose</MT> 
increase <MT>camp</MT> which will increase phorphokinase which will increase <MT>phorphorylase</MT> and increase <MT>glucose phosphate</MT> 
only small amount of <MT>glucose</MT> is necessary to have greater effects because of amplification 
at really high concentrations it can increase heart contraction increase <MT>blood flow</MT> to organs increase bile secretion an block <MT>gastric acid</MT> 
<MT>somatostatin</MT> regulated by <MT>high glucose amino acids</MT> <MT>fatty acids</MT> and git <MT>hormones</MT> 
effects of <MT>somatostatin</MT> decrease <MT>insulin</MT> and <MT>glucagon</MT>

the <MT>islet pathophysiology</MT> group focuses on defining the mechanisms underlying <MT>pancreatic islet</MT> malfunction and decreased <MT>beta cell</MT> mass in type <MT>diabetes</MT> 
the <MT>disease</MT> has in recent years been associated to variations in large number of <MT>genes</MT> 
the big challenge is to understand exactly how these <MT>genetic variations</MT> affect <MT>cellular</MT> functions in the <MT>pancreatic islets</MT> in order to identify targets for causative treatment 
focus areas include the role of the redox environment with particular focus on effectors of <MT>nadph</MT> and their consequences for <MT>beta cell function</MT> and survival 
the role of <MT>complement proteins</MT> of the <MT>innate immune system</MT> for control of <MT>insulin secretion</MT> from the <MT>pancreatic beta cell</MT> in health and <MT>disease</MT> 
this is done in collaborate with the group of anna blom lund university and other international collaborators 
<MT>ion channels in particular voltage gated</MT> ca channels and their role in type <MT>diabetes</MT> in collaboration with some of the leading profiles in the area 
methods used include the <MT>patch clamp</MT> technique in combination with <MT>microfluorimetry</MT> or <MT>cellular imaging</MT> techniques such as <MT>confocal</MT> or <MT>tirf imaging</MT> 
imaging methods established include <MT>multiphoton imaging</MT> and <MT>fluorescence spectrum correlation</MT> 
in addition we perform <MT>hormone release assays</MT> <MT>immunocytochemistry</MT> <MT>standard biochemistry</MT> and manipulation of <MT>gene expression</MT> using <MT>rna interference</MT> or viral transfer methods 
in an effort to go beyond the <MT>single gene</MT> one function paradigm and do develop models that take into account the contribution of several <MT>genes</MT> and their encoded <MT>proteins for the altered cellular functions</MT> that predispose for type <MT>diabetes</MT> and how aberrations in these networks can be corrected by novel treatmentts 
to do this we analyse gene regulatory co expression networdks in <MT>pancreatic islets</MT> followed by functional validation experiments down to detailed molecular level when appropriate 
an important aspect of protein function is their interactions addressed by discovery techniques hybrid systems and focused low throughput methods 
<MT>immunoprecipitation</MT> affinity purification including those that make it possible to characterize interactions in real time fluctuation correlation spectroscopy 
after discovery and validation the ultimate goal is to translate findings into improved diagnostics and novel molecular targets for treatment of type <MT>diabetes</MT>

how to reverse <MT>diabetes</MT> 
turns out the <MT>diabetes</MT> industry is selling us fake research 
hi 
robo suzie and today ll talk to you about is the <MT>pancreatic islet transplantation</MT> feasible cure for <MT>diabetes</MT> 
also don forget to check out the link below to find out how this guy reversed his <MT>diabetes</MT> 
turns out the <MT>diabetes</MT> industry is selling us fake research 
but back to our topic 
the <MT>pancreatic islet transplantation</MT> or what is known as the <MT>edmonton protocol</MT> is an <MT>experimental procedure</MT> that makes use of <MT>islets</MT> extracted from </MT>the pancreas</MT> of recently deceased <MT>organ donor</MT> 
the process involves the transplant of said <MT>islets</MT> to patient suffering from <MT>diabetes</MT> type the <MT>beta cells</MT> of these <MT>transplanted islets</MT> are expected to produce the <MT>insulin</MT> lacked by the type <MT>diabetes patient</MT> 
this experiment then hopes to provide the cure for <MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> 
diabetes type is that <MT>diabetic</MT> condition where the <MT>beta cells of the pancreas</MT> is unable to produce <MT>insulin</MT> as result of the attacks launched by the body <MT>immune system</MT> 
the <MT>transplantation of islet</MT> therefore is expected to provide cure for <MT>diabetes</MT> type patients which will enable them to live normal life <MT>free from insulin dependence</MT>
although the <MT>diabetes</MT> type condition deals with <MT>insulin resistance</MT> it has been noted that the <MT>diabetic condition</MT> of the patient will also develop to <MT>insulin</MT> decline or progress later on as <MT>diabetes</MT> type many supporters of the <MT>pancreatic islet transplantation</MT> believe that this will also be cure for <MT>diabetes</MT> type to relieve sufferers of their eventual need for <MT>insulin injections</MT> 
the <MT>islets</MT> referred to here are the <MT>cluster of cells</MT> or <MT>tissues</MT> known in the medical world as islets of langerhans 
these <MT>islets</MT> are microscopic and are scattered throughout the <MT>pancreas</MT> forming part of the <MT>endocrine glands</MT> 
they contain the cells which secret the <MT>beta cells</MT> that produce the <MT>insulin</MT> necessary for <MT>glucose</MT> absorption and any failure of these <MT>islets</MT> to produce these <MT>beta cells</MT> lead to <MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> or type <MT>diabetes</MT> 
although clinically promising at first year follow up after the transplantation procedure was made and the results were not as favourable as expected 
only ten percent of the patients remained <MT>free of insulin</MT> dependence while the rest went back to the use of <MT>insulin shots</MT> since the <MT>transplanted islets</MT> eventually lost its ability to produce <MT>insulin</MT> 
the only benefits that the latter group of patients gained was their less demand for <MT>insulin</MT> since the patients were able to achieve <MT>glucose stability</MT> 
hence to date <MT>pancreatic transplantation</MT> has not gained the medical support as the ultimate cure for <MT>diabetes</MT> 
it is also believed that the eventual failure of the <MT>transplanted islet</MT> to produce <MT>insulin</MT> was also attributed to the <MT>body immune system</MT> 
the <MT>beta cells</MT> produced by the <MT>transplanted islets</MT> were also attacked by the <MT>body immune system</MT>
hence in the same way that the <MT>natural beta cells</MT> of the body were impaired the patient still suffers from <MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> or <MT>diabetes</MT> type critics say that it was actually project doomed from the beginning others pointed out that the root of the <MT>insulin</MT> impairment problem was the inability of the <MT>immune system</MT> to recognize <MT>insulin beta cells</MT> as essential to <MT>digestive functions</MT> instead of treating these <MT>insulin cells</MT> as <MT>bacteria</MT> 
perhaps further experimentations therefore in the search for the elusive cure for <MT>diabetes</MT> should have more concern in orienting the <MT>auto immune system</MT> on how to recognize friendly and non friendly substances found in the body

<MT>pancreatic islet transplantation</MT> represents promising treatment for patients with but shortage of available <MT>healthy islet donors</MT> means that there is an insufficient supply of <MT>insulin</MT> producing <MT>islets</MT> to meet the demands for such therapies
thus research efforts over the last decade have focused on <MT>generating artificial islets</MT> from human <MT>pluripotent stem cells</MT> <MT>hpscs</MT> as <MT>prospective solution</MT> to this scarcity

<MT>diabetes</MT> refers to group of conditions characterized by <MT>high level of blood glucose</MT> commonly referred to as <MT>blood sugar</MT> 
too much <MT>sugar in the blood</MT> can cause serious sometimes life threatening health problems 
there are two types of <MT>chronic diabetic conditions</MT> type <MT>diabetes</MT> and type <MT>diabetes</MT> 
pregnant women may acquire transient form of the <MT>disease</MT> called <MT>gestational diabetes</MT> which usually resolves after the birth of baby 
<MT>pre diabetes</MT> is when the <MT>blood sugar level</MT> is at the borderline higher than normal but lower than in <MT>diabetics</MT> 
<MT>prediabetes</MT> may or may not progress to <MT>diabetes</MT> 
during food digestion <MT>carbohydrates</MT> or carb break down into <MT>glucose</MT> which is carried by the <MT>bloodstream</MT> to various <MT>organs</MT> of the body 
here it is either consumed as an energy source in <MT>muscles</MT> for example or is stored for later use in the <MT>liver</MT> 
<MT>insulin</MT> is <MT>hormone</MT> produced by <MT>beta cells of the pancreas</MT> and is necessary for <MT>glucose</MT> intake by <MT>target cells</MT> 
in other words when <MT>insulin</MT> is deficient <MT>muscle</MT> or <MT>liver cells</MT> are unable to use or store <MT>glucose</MT> and as result <MT>glucose</MT> accumulates in the blood 
in healthy people <MT>beta cells of the pancreas</MT> produce <MT>insulin</MT> <MT>insulin</MT> binds to its receptor on <MT>target cells</MT> and induces <MT>glucose</MT> intake 
in type <MT>diabetes</MT> <MT>beta cells</MT> of the <MT>pancreas</MT> are destroyed by the <MT>immune system</MT> by mistake 
the reason why this happens is unclear but genetic factors are believed to play major role 
<MT>insulin production</MT> is reduced less <MT>insulin</MT> binds to its receptor on <MT>target cells</MT> less <MT>glucose</MT> is taken into the cells more <MT>glucose</MT> stays in the <MT>blood</MT> 
type is characterized by early onset symptoms commonly start suddenly and before the age of type <MT>diabetes</MT> is normally managed with <MT>insulin injection</MT> 
type <MT>diabetics</MT> are therefore <MT>insulin dependent</MT> 
in type <MT>diabetes</MT> the <MT>pancreas</MT> produces enough <MT>insulin</MT> but something goes wrong either with receptor binding or <MT>insulin signaling</MT> inside the <MT>target cells</MT> 
the cells are not responsive to <MT>insulin</MT> and therefore cannot import <MT>glucose glucose stays in the blood</MT> 
in other words type <MT>diabetics</MT> are <MT>insulin resistant</MT> 
here again genetic factors predispose susceptibility to the <MT>disease</MT> but it is believed that lifestyle plays very important role in type typically <MT>obesity</MT> inactive lifestyle and unhealthy diet are associated with higher risk of type <MT>diabetes</MT> 
type is characterized by adult onset symptoms usually appear gradually and start after the age of type <MT>diabetes</MT> accounts for about to of all <MT>diabetics</MT> 
management focuses on weight loss and includes low carb diet

more and more people are suffering from type <MT>diabetes</MT> due to variety of reasons including diet exercise and genetics 
according to new study from researchers at harvard medical school in massachusetts working with an expert from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in germany <MT>genetic predisposition</MT> for <MT>diabetes</MT> in latin american populations might be related to <MT>gene</MT> variant passed down from neanderthals 
more and more people are suffering from type <MT>diabetes</MT> due to variety of reasons including diet exercise and genetics 
according to new study from researchers at harvard medical school in massachusetts working with an expert from the max planck institute for <MT>evolutionary anthropology</MT> in germany <MT>genetic predisposition</MT> for <MT>diabetes</MT> in latin american populations might be related to <MT>gene</MT> variant passed down from neanderthals 
genome wide association study that analyzed the genes of thousand mexicans and other latin americans shows that subjects who have the <MT>gene</MT> are percent more likely to have <MT>diabetes</MT> and people who have versions of the <MT>gene</MT> from both parents are percent more likely to get <MT>diabetes</MT> 
around percent of east asians have the <MT>gene</MT> variant but it is rarely found in european or african populations 
neanderthals went extinct around thousand years ago but they are believed to have interbred with other human species based on genetic evidence from remains found in <MT>denisova cave</MT> in siberia 
percent of non african human genomes are reportedly made up of neanderthal <MT>dna</MT> 
what do you think about the predisposition for <MT>diabetes</MT> being connected with <MT>genes</MT> from neanderthals 
genisyss http www genisyss com helps the average person store their <MT>dna</MT> and keep it in their own possession 
why 
because <MT>dna</MT> changes over lifetime of exposure to the sun radiation pollution chemicals smoking and even stress 
today <MT>dna</MT> is used to identify predispositions to medical conditions including cancer <MT>heart disease</MT> <MT>diabetes</MT> <MT>autism tourette</MT> and many others 
by identifying this early and staying mindful your stored <MT>dna</MT> from earlier in your life or your parent may be used to treat and prevent the expression of any <MT>diseases</MT> that show up in your <MT>dna</MT> 
in this video talk about <MT>epigenetics</MT> 
this is the study of the factors that turn on or off <MT>gene expression</MT> 
when we see doctor they will want to know your family medical history
they do this to find out if you are predisposed to <MT>disease</MT> by genetics ie if your mother had <MT>diabetes</MT> there is high chance you will too 
what research regarding <MT>epigenetics</MT> has found is that even though you have predisposition to an illness <MT>disease</MT> that <MT>gene</MT> can be silenced or actioned by diet stress lifestyle environmental factors 
alot of our habits we learnt was when we were children were learnt from our parents or caregivers 
so if we live our lives using these habits we learnt from our parents we will most likely action that gene 
while if we change our habits lets say better diet we can silence that <MT>gene</MT> and not manifest that illness 
check the video out and let me know what you think 
www trulyholistic net
an in depth view of studies highlighting the hidden drivers of type and <MT>diabetes</MT> and well diet to mitigate and possibly reverse them altogether 
maybe watch this is segments because it sorta long and extra loaded with science 
for each extra or few bites of meat that you consume you have an increased chance of getting <MT>diabetes</MT> 
an excerpt from the audiobook the language of god scientist presents evidence for belief by physician <MT>geneticist</MT> francis collins appendix section of disc tracks 
transcript according to the national institute of health about of people with type <MT>diabetes</MT> are overweight or <MT>obese</MT> 
without doubt <MT>obesity</MT> is major risk factor for type <MT>diabetes</MT> because increased <MT>body fat</MT> makes it difficult for the body to use <MT>insulin</MT> properly 
does this mean that <MT>diabetes</MT> is just <MT>disease</MT> of the <MT>obese</MT> 
unfortunately being skinny is not always protection against <MT>diabetes</MT> 
many who do not fit the typical physical description of <MT>diabetic overweight</MT> and older can get <MT>diabetes</MT> 
although increased body weight is risk factor for <MT>diabetes</MT> it is not the only risk factor 
lean people can be at risk for type <MT>diabetes</MT> for other reasons not directly related to body weight 
this risk however is low especially in comparison to <MT>obese</MT> individuals 
it in the <MT>genes</MT> aside from commonly known risk factors for <MT>diabetes</MT> such as excess weight and old age there are two strong risk factors for <MT>diabetes</MT> that are often overlooked <MT>genes</MT> and family history 
some people are born more likely to have <MT>diabetes</MT> regardless of their weight 
in fact according to the american <MT>diabetes</MT> association type <MT>diabetes</MT> has stronger link to family history than type <MT>diabetes</MT> especially in twins 
if one twin has type the other twin risk is up to 
research study published in plos genetics found that most lean cases are people with strong <MT>genetic predisposition</MT> for type <MT>diabetes</MT> 
even family history of <MT>heart disease</MT> can increase person risk for <MT>diabetes</MT> 
lifestyle it important to note that in the field of health and nutrition the word skinny does not always mean healthy 
even relatively skinny person can have poor diet and low activity levels 
unhealthy lifestyle choices can increase the risk for <MT>diabetes</MT> 
low physical activity encourages <MT>insulin resistance</MT> 
coupled with poor diet sedentary lifestyle can lead to increased body <MT>fat</MT> especially dangerous type of <MT>body fat</MT> called <MT>visceral fat</MT> 
this type of <MT>fat</MT> is not the <MT>fat</MT> found under the skin 
this is the <MT>fat</MT> that surrounds internal <MT>organs</MT> especially around the waist area 
such poor lifestyle choices increase the risk of <MT>hypertension</MT> <MT>high cholesterol</MT> and <MT>high triglyceride levels</MT> in the <MT>blood</MT> 
all of these health problems can encourage the development of type <MT>diabetes</MT> as well 
smoking can also increase your risk for type <MT>diabetes</MT> regardless of your body weight 
according to the american journal of <MT>epidemiology</MT> heavy smoker cigarettes day has risk for type <MT>diabetes</MT> three times greater than that of non smoker 
specific populations research has shown that certain population groups are more susceptible to <MT>diabetes</MT> than others 
for example thin cases of <MT>diabetes</MT> are more common in the elderly or certain non caucasian ethnicities 
these include african americans native americans hispanic latino americans asian americans and pacific islanders 
since these ethnic backgrounds are more vulnerable to <MT>diabetes</MT> body weight may not make huge difference in the risk for <MT>diabetes</MT> 
during pregnancy women can develop temporary type of <MT>diabetes</MT> called <MT>gestational diabetes</MT> 
if this occurs their chances of developing type <MT>diabetes</MT> are higher for the next decade or so regardless of their weight 
if woman gave birth to at least one baby weighing more than pounds she is at increased risk for developing type <MT>diabetes</MT> regardless of her weight or family history 
understand <MT>diabetes</MT> to prevent or delay it there are overweight people without <MT>diabetes</MT> and thin people with <MT>diabetes</MT> 
however the <MT>diabetes</MT> epidemic nationally and globally lies mainly but not exclusively in <MT>obese</MT> individuals 
according to study published in <MT>diabetology amp metabolic syndrome</MT> the risk of developing type <MT>diabetes</MT> for overweight people is about times higher than normal weight individuals 
many of the risk factors for type <MT>diabetes</MT> in lean people are out of their control such as family history or <MT>genes</MT> 
weight on the other hand is factor that can be controlled 
if you are at risk for type <MT>diabetes</MT> weight loss is an important measure to take to prevent or delay the <MT>onset of diabetes</MT> 
the facts show that people can develop type <MT>diabetes</MT> at any age or weight even during childhood or in lean person 
however this type of <MT>diabetes</MT> develops most often in middle aged and older people 
regardless of the risk factors you may or may not have it is important to recognize the warning signs of <MT>diabetes</MT> and to make healthy lifestyle choices that can help prevent it 
aidan power at pfizer speculates about <MT>obesity</MT> and <MT>diabetes</MT> <MT>genes</MT> and whether behavioral changes can trounce our biology 
we all have heard about the <MT>thrifty genes</MT> 
but what are the various other factors that lead to <MT>diabetes</MT> and how to keep them at bay 
dr jaydeep shinde tells us about the need to reckon with <MT>diabetes</MT> even before its onset so that we can postpone the related complications effectively

how to reverse <MT>diabetes</MT> 
turns out the <MT>diabetes</MT> industry is selling us fake research 
hi
robo suzie and today ll talk to you about <MT>diabetes</MT> african americans deadly foe 
also don forget to check out the link below to find out how this guy reversed his <MT>diabetes</MT> 
turns out the <MT>diabetes industry</MT> is selling us fake research 
but back to our topic 
<MT>diabetes</MT> is having devastating effect on the african american community 
<MT>diabetes</MT> is the fifth leading cause of death in african americans and their death rates are twenty seven percent higher than whites 
over million african americans have <MT>diabetes</MT> and one third of them don know they have the <MT>disease</MT> 
in addition twenty five percent of african americans between the ages of have <MT>diabetes</MT> and one in four african american women over the age of have been diagnosed with the <MT>disease</MT> the cause of <MT>diabetes</MT> is mystery but researchers believe that both genetics and environmental factors play roles in who will develop the <MT>disease</MT> 
heredity 
researchers believe that african americans and african immigrants are predisposed to developing <MT>diabetes</MT> 
research suggests that african americans and recent african immigrants have inherited <MT>thrifty gene</MT> from their african ancestors 
this <MT>gene</MT> may have enabled africans to use food energy more efficiently during cycles of feast and famine 
now with fewer cycles of feast and famine this <MT>gene</MT> may make weight control more difficult for african americans and african immigrants 
this <MT>genetic predisposition</MT> coupled with <MT>impaired glucose tolerance</MT> is often associated with the genetic tendency toward <MT>high blood pressure</MT> 
people with <MT>impaired glucose tolerance</MT> have higher than normal <MT>blood glucose levels</MT> and are at higher risk for developing <MT>diabetes</MT> 
what is <MT>diabetes</MT> 
<MT>diabetes</MT> commonly know as <MT>sugar diabetes</MT> is condition that occurs when the body is unable to properly produce or use <MT>insulin</MT> 
<MT>insulin</MT> is needed by the body to process sugar starches and other foods into energy 
<MT>diabetes</MT> is chronic condition for which there is no known cure <MT>diabetes</MT> is serious <MT>disease</MT> and should not be ignored 
<MT>diabetics</MT> often suffer from <MT>low glucose levels</MT> <MT>sugar in their blood</MT> 
<MT>low blood sugar levels</MT> can make you disorientated dizzy sweaty hungry have <MT>headaches</MT> have sudden mood swings have difficulty paying attention or have <MT>tingling sensations around the mouth</MT> 
types of <MT>diabetes</MT> 
<MT>pre diabetes</MT> is condition that occurs when person <MT>blood glucose levels</MT> is higher than normal but not high enough for <MT>diagnosis of type diabetes</MT> 
<MT>pre diabetes</MT> can cause damage to the <MT>heart</MT> and <MT>circulatory system</MT> but <MT>pre diabetes</MT> can often be controlled by controlling <MT>blood glucose levels</MT> 
by controlling <MT>pre diabetes</MT> you can often prevent or delay the onset of type <MT>diabetes</MT>

five to ten percent of african americans who are diagnosed with <MT>diabetes</MT> are diagnosed with this type of the <MT>disease</MT> 
type <MT>diabetes</MT> is an <MT>autoimmune disease</MT> where the body produces little or no <MT>insulin</MT> and this type of <MT>disease</MT> must be treated with <MT>daily insulin injections</MT> 
type or <MT>adult onset diabetes</MT> is responsible for ninety to ninety five percent of diagnosed <MT>diabetes</MT> cases in african americans 
type results from condition where the body fails to properly use <MT>insulin</MT> 
according to the american <MT>diabetes</MT> association type is usually found in people over who have <MT>diabetes</MT> in their family who are overweight who don exercise and who have <MT>cholesterol</MT> problems 
in the early stages it can often be controlled with lifestyle changes but in the later stages diabetic pills or <MT>insulin injections</MT> are often needed 
<MT>pregnancy related diabetes</MT> or <MT>gestational diabetes</MT> can occur in pregnant women 
<MT>gestational diabetes</MT> is often associated with <MT>high glucose blood levels</MT> or <MT>hyperglycemia</MT> 
<MT>gestational diabetes</MT> affects about four percent of all pregnant women 
the <MT>disease</MT> usually goes away after delivery but women who suffer from <MT>gestational diabetes</MT> are at higher risk for developing <MT>diabetes</MT> later in life 
symptoms of <MT>diabetes</MT> 
the most common symptoms of <MT>diabetes</MT> include <MT>excessive urination</MT> including frequent trips to the bathroom 
increased thirst

visit cure to know more is <MT>diabetes</MT> genetic you ve probably wondered how you developed <MT>diabetes</MT> 
you may worry that your children will develop it too 
unlike some traits <MT>diabetes</MT> does not seem to be inherited in simple pattern 
yet clearly some people are born more likely to develop <MT>diabetes</MT> than others 
what leads to <MT>diabetes</MT> 
type and type <MT>diabetes</MT> have different causes 
yet two factors are important in both 
you inherit predisposition to the disease then something in your environment triggers it 
genes alone are not enough 
one proof of this is identical twins 
identical twins have identical <MT>genes</MT> 
yet when one twin has type <MT>diabetes</MT> the other gets the <MT>disease</MT> at most only half the time 
when one twin has type <MT>diabetes</MT> the other risk is at most in type <MT>diabetes</MT> in most cases of type <MT>diabetes</MT> people need to inherit risk factors from both parents 
we think these factors must be more common in whites because whites have the highest rate of type <MT>diabetes</MT> 
because most people who are at risk do not get <MT>diabetes</MT> researchers want to find out what the environmental triggers are 
one trigger might be related to cold weather 
type <MT>diabetes</MT> develops more often in winter than summer and is more common in places with cold climates 
another trigger might be viruses 
perhaps virus that has only mild effects on most people triggers type <MT>diabetes</MT> in others 
early diet may also play role 
type <MT>diabetes</MT> is less common in people who were breastfed and in those who first ate solid foods at later ages 
in many people the development of type <MT>diabetes</MT> seems to take many years 
in experiments that followed relatives of people with type <MT>diabetes</MT> researchers found that most of those who later got <MT>diabetes</MT> had certain <MT>autoantibodies</MT> in their <MT>blood</MT> for years before 
<MT>antibodies</MT> are proteins that destroy <MT>bacteria</MT> or viruses 
<MT>autoantibodies</MT> are <MT>antibodies</MT> gone bad which attack the body own <MT>tissues</MT> 
type <MT>diabetes</MT> type <MT>diabetes</MT> has stronger link to family history and lineage than type although it too depends on environmental factors 
studies of twins have shown that genetics play very strong role in the development of type <MT>diabetes</MT> 
lifestyle also influences the development of type <MT>diabetes</MT> 
<MT>obesity</MT> tends to run in families and families tend to have similar eating and exercise habits 
if you have family history of type <MT>diabetes</MT> it may be difficult to figure out whether your <MT>diabetes</MT> is due to lifestyle factors or <MT>genetic susceptibility</MT> 
most likely it is due to both 
however don lose <MT>heart</MT> 
studies show that it is possible to delay or prevent type <MT>diabetes</MT> by exercising and losing weight

ental scientists first turned their attention to understanding the biologic plausibility of how <MT>periodontitis</MT> might confer risk for <MT>systemic disease</MT> 
<MT>cardiovascular diseases</MT> <MT>cvd</MT> primarily are result of <MT>atherosclerosis</MT> and are the number one cause of mortality worldwide 
increasing evidence over the past decade suggests that <MT>severe periodontal disease</MT> is associated with increased <MT>cardiovascular disease</MT> risk 
several possible mechanisms may operate independently or in concert to explain this association 
the mechanisms resulting in pathology from both <MT>periodontitis</MT> and <MT>cvd</MT> are similar both <MT>diseases</MT> have complex causation that includes genetic and <MT>gender predispositions</MT> age <MT>diabetes</MT> smoking social status and stress

let me begin by saying categorically that at the time of this video there is no cure for <MT>diabetes</MT> 
<MT>diabetes</MT> management book there are literally thousands of claims out there saying their product or their program can cure your <MT>diabetes</MT> 
simply put they cannot 
but this question asks if <MT>diabetes</MT> can be reversed 
so to begin this conversation we need to define what we mean by reversed 
if we are saying we can take our bodies back to the time before we had <MT>diabetes</MT> then no 
if we are talking about state in which we can control our <MT>blood sugar</MT> without the use of any medications then the answer is maybe 
let talk about those with type <MT>diabetes</MT> first 
if you have type then you are <MT>insulin dependent</MT> 
when you were first diagnosed you may have gone through what is called honeymoon period in which your <MT>blood sugar</MT> kept dropping and dropping and you used less and less <MT>insulin</MT> 
you may have even stopped using it altogether 
by the way researchers now feel that type need to continue small <MT>insulin injections</MT> to protect what <MT>insulin producing cells</MT> they still have 
but this honeymoon period will not last forever 
if you have type <MT>diabetes</MT> then approximately of your <MT>insulin producing cells</MT> have been destroyed 
they have not been damaged with chance of repair they are gone 
it is impossible to reverse the damage done 
while some think their <MT>diabetes</MT> has been cured or even reversed this is false sense of security 
the process that destroyed the of <MT>insulin producing cells</MT> with destroy the remaining 
ultimately you will be totally dependent on <MT>insulin</MT> 
type <MT>diabetes</MT> cannot be reversed 
and this is not my opinion it is the opinion of the foremost <MT>diabetes</MT> center in the world the joslin <MT>diabetes</MT> center in boston 
as far as type <MT>diabetes</MT> as long as we are clear on the definition of reversal will say it is possible 
remember am adamant about the fact that there is no cure for <MT>diabetes</MT> but do feel it is possible for person with type to be able to go off their <MT>diabetes</MT> meds for time and control their <MT>blood sugar</MT> 
that would be reversal 
we cannot go back and reverse the damage done by having <MT>diabetes</MT> but it is possible to control <MT>diabetes</MT> without medication 
the most recent reliable research could find on this subject was conducted in march of it was conducted professor roy taylor professor of medicine and <MT>metabolism</MT> at newcastle university in new castle england 
the work was an extension of study that was in question because of the brevity of the study 
that study had theory that this research is part of growing body of evidence showing that people with type <MT>diabetes</MT> who successfully lose weight can reverse their condition because <MT>fat</MT> is removed from their <MT>pancreas</MT> returning insulin production to normal in the study volunteers with type went on strict diet of calories per day for months 
now let me warn you right now that is not lot of food in calories 
however the participants lost an average of pounds 
they had to keep this weight off for another months 
the results were that of those with type who had been diagnosed less than years reversed their <MT>diabetes</MT> 
for those who had been diagnosed longer did not have the same results 
the key to reversing <MT>diabetes</MT> is to lose weight and regular exercise 
in another study discussed by michael dansinger md those with type exercised for minutes week limited their calories to to per day and got weekly counseling and education on these lifestyle changes 
within year about got off their <MT>diabetes</MT> medications or improved to the point where their <MT>blood sugar level</MT> was no longer in the <MT>diabetes</MT> range and was instead classified as <MT>prediabetes</MT> in every study researched it was apparent that the numbers of those who were able to reverse their <MT>diabetes</MT> were largely dependent on the date of diagnosis 
those who were newbies had better chance of reversal 
but even at that the average of those who have been able to reverse their <MT>diabetes</MT> has been about 
weight loss and exercise will not work for everyone 
part of that reason is that some people are simply predisposed to <MT>diabetes</MT> 
it in your <MT>genes</MT> 
the reason we also call this reversal rather than cure 
for those who have experienced reversal and then gained their weight back guess what happens 
they need to start their <MT>diabetes</MT> meds again 
can attest to that first hand 
as pound man was in bad shape in more ways that one 
dropped pounds on <MT>fad diet</MT> 
it was great 
no longer needed any <MT>diabetes</MT> meds felt awesome and this went on for about years 
but then the diet was on started affecting other parts of my body 
got very ill was told had to stop the fad diet and try to return to normal diet or something bad was going to happen 
what is <MT>thrifty gene hypothesis</MT> 
what does <MT>thrifty gene hypothesis</MT> mean 
<MT>thrifty gene hypothesis</MT> meaning <MT>thrifty gene hypothesis</MT> definition <MT>thrifty gene hypothesis</MT> explanation 
source wikipedia org article adapted under license 
the <MT>thrifty gene hypothesis</MT> or <MT>gianfranco hypothesis</MT> is an attempt by geneticist james neel to explain why certain populations and subpopulations in the modern day are prone to <MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> type he proposed the hypothesis in to resolve fundamental problem <MT>diabetes</MT> is clearly very harmful medical condition yet it is quite common and it was already evident to neel that it likely had strong genetic basis 
the problem is to understand how <MT>disease</MT> with likely genetic component and with such negative effects may have been favoured by the process of natural selection 
neel suggested the resolution to this problem is that genes which predispose to <MT>diabetes</MT> called <MT>thrifty genes</MT> were historically advantageous but they became detrimental in the modern world 
in his words they were rendered detrimental by progress 
neel primary interest was in <MT>diabetes</MT> but the idea was soon expanded to encompass <MT>obesity</MT> as well 
<MT>thrifty genes</MT> are <MT>genes</MT> which enable individuals to efficiently collect and process food to deposit <MT>fat</MT> during periods of food abundance in order to provide for periods of food shortage feast and famine 
according to the hypothesis the <MT>thrifty genotype</MT> would have been advantageous for hunter gatherer populations especially child bearing women because it would allow them to fatten more quickly during times of abundance 
<MT>fatter</MT> individuals carrying the <MT>thrifty genes</MT> would thus better survive times of food scarcity 
however in modern societies with constant abundance of food this <MT>genotype</MT> efficiently prepares individuals for famine that never comes 
the result of this mismatch between the environment in which the <MT>brain</MT> evolved and the environment of today is widespread <MT>chronic obesity</MT> and related health problems like <MT>diabetes</MT> 
the hypothesis has received various criticisms and several modified or alternative hypotheses have been proposed the <MT>thrifty phenotype hypothesis</MT> arose from challenges posed to the <MT>thrifty gene hypothesis</MT> 
the <MT>thrifty phenotype hypothesis</MT> theorizes that instead of arising genetically the <MT>thrifty factors</MT> developed as direct result of the environment within the <MT>womb</MT> during development 
the development of <MT>insulin resistance</MT> is theorized to be directly related to the body predicting life of starvation for the <MT>developing fetus</MT> 
hence one of the main causes of type <MT>diabetes</MT> has been attributed to poor <MT>fetal</MT> and infant growth and the subsequent development of the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> 
since the hypothesis was proposed many studies world wide have confirmed the initial <MT>epidemiological</MT> evidence 
although the relationship with <MT>insulin resistance</MT> is clear at all ages studied the relation of <MT>insulin secretion</MT> is less clear 
the relative contribution of genes and environment to these relationships remains matter of debate 
other relevant observations arose from <MT>metabolism</MT> researchers who note that for practically every other species on earth <MT>fat metabolism</MT> is well regulated and that most wild animals are in fact very lean and that they remain lean even when adequate food is supplied 
many attempts have been made to search for one or more genes contributing to thrift 
modern tools of genome wide association studies have revealed many genes with small effects associated with <MT>obesity</MT> or type <MT>diabetes</MT> but all of them together explain only between and of population variance 
this leaves large gap between the pregenomic and emerging genomic estimates of <MT>heritability of obesity</MT> and type <MT>diabetes</MT> sometimes called the missing heritability 
we are yet to understand the reasons for this discrepancy 
donations to support this channel can be made here causing even <MT>increase in insulin</MT> release from the <MT>pancreas</MT> 
so number one what will cause an overstimulation of <MT>insulin</MT> is excessive amounts of <MT>carbohydrates</MT> 
secondly <MT>proteins in the absence of glucose</MT> could also cause small increases in <MT>insulin secretion</MT> 
another thing to note is that if you add <MT>carbohydrates</MT> with <MT>amino acids</MT> your <MT>insulin secretion</MT> would otherwise be doubled 
what this means is burgers with fries pancakes with eggs chicken with pasta all these combinations will double your <MT>insulin secretion</MT> 
the third thing affecting insulin secretion are <MT>gastrointestinal hormones</MT> that are triggered when we eat 
what this means is that whenever you eat regardless of what it is <MT>insulin</MT> will be secreted to some degree 
there other <MT>hormones</MT> part of the autonomic <MT>nervous system</MT> such as <MT>cortisol</MT> which upon getting released will trigger <MT>insulin secretion</MT> 
what causes <MT>cortisol</MT> release excessive stress 
given these points as whole nowhere did say <MT>fat</MT> effects <MT>insulin</MT> to large degree 
this leads into what would recommend for others and myself if had <MT>diabetes</MT> which is to eat low carb <MT>high fat diet</MT> 
this means keeping your <MT>carbohydrate</MT> intake somewhere around grams day depending on an individuals severity 
overtime when the <MT>pancreas</MT> get break and everything begins to stay within equilibrium then an individual can start to incorporate more <MT>carbohydrates</MT> 
something want to mention though is that if you don suffer from <MT>diabetes</MT> and you don have any <MT>genetic predispositions</MT> for it you don really have to worry much about your <MT>carbohydrate</MT> intake per day 
people with <MT>insulin resistance</MT> or <MT>diabetes</MT> need to worry about it because their <MT>hypersensitive</MT> 
now this doesn mean eat whatever you want because over consumption food especially processed and refined foods will predispose you to <MT>insulin resistance</MT> 
so with all this being said feel comfortable now making food recommendations 
the <MT>genetic predisposition</MT> <MT>dna</MT> health test is an innovative test which allows you to discover whether you are <MT>genetically predisposed</MT> towards developing number of <MT>diseases</MT> and medical conditions including <MT>cardiovascular conditions</MT> different types of <MT>cancers disorders</MT> of the <MT>immune system</MT> <MT>diabetes</MT> as well as medical conditions related to ageing

it growing problem in more ways than one 
the last quarter century has seen an explosion of <MT>diabetes</MT> in the unfortunately it doesn surprise me that <MT>diabetes</MT> is on the rise with our aging population and with the increased prevalence of <MT>obesity</MT> says sharon krispinsky 
sharon is certified <MT>diabetes educator</MT> with lee memorial <MT>health system</MT> 
in someone who has the <MT>genetic predisposition</MT> for developing <MT>diabetes</MT> as you gain weight you become more <MT>insulin</MT> resistant meaning that you cant use the sugar or <MT>glucose</MT> in your <MT>blood</MT> says krispinsky 
new health survey shows americans are being diagnosed with <MT>diabetes</MT> at twice the rate of people i n western europe 
dangerous trend since <MT>diabetes</MT> is linked to multitude of health issues and its complications can be deadly 
it can cause <MT>multi symptom</MT> <MT>organ failure</MT> including blindness in the <MT>eye heart disease</MT> 
it increases your risk of <MT>heart attack</MT> <MT>kidney disease</MT> it increases your risk of going on <MT>dialysis</MT> or having <MT>kidney failure</MT> 
you can have low circulation because the high sugar attacks every <MT>organ in the body</MT> saysdraldith lewis an internal medicine physician with lee memorial health system 
despite the sobering statistics there is hope 
research has shown that even with modest weight loss and regular exercise and when say modest weight loss its to percent of your body weight you could reduce your risk of developing <MT>diabetes</MT> by percent says krispinsky 
so when it comes to lowering the rate of <MT>diabetes</MT> the best medicine might be education 
through our community outreach programs we really are trying to get that message across says krispinsky

hi and welcome 
ll be speaking today about <MT>diabetic ketoacidosis</MT> or dka 
my name is michael agus 
am <MT>pediatric intensive care doctor</MT> and <MT>pediatric endocrinologist</MT> at boston children hospital 
the director of the medicine critical care program here at children and an assistant professor at harvard medical school 
ll start by explaining how one gets <MT>diabetes</MT> to begin with because it surprise to many that <MT>diabetes</MT> really occurs develops over period of many many months 
when <MT>endocrinologists</MT> in boston set up the <MT>diabetes prevention</MT> trial or dpt several years ago although we weren able to stop the onset of <MT>diabetes</MT> we were able to track people getting <MT>diabetes</MT> 
and the way we chose the most likely people to get <MT>diabetes</MT> were to look at first degree relatives of patients with <MT>diabetes</MT> 
we know that patients who are about to get <MT>diabetes</MT> have <MT>genetic predisposition</MT> and then they have some environmental component that occurs at some point in their life 
we don understand what that environmental component is but we understand that if you have that <MT>genetic predisposition</MT> you are at risk to be affected by the environmental exposure 
when trying to identify patients at increased risk those first degree relatives so siblings parents children instead of having the usual background rate in the north american population for example of roughly of type <MT>diabetes people</MT> who have first degree relative with <MT>diabetes</MT> are at tenfold increased risk and now have incidence of type diabetes 
so you went from in to in by following these people who are at increased risk of getting diabetes we can understand that they begin to lose <MT>beta cell function</MT> months and months and months prior to the onset of clinical symptoms of <MT>diabetes</MT> 
so if we were going to take an example of child who is developing <MT>diabetes</MT> we could look at this particular graph 
and you see that even though she didn know she was on her way to get <MT>diabetes</MT> she been losing <MT>beta cell function</MT> <MT>beta cell</MT> mass from <MT>autoimmune destruction</MT> over period of many months 
when she at the point that you see here there no symptoms whatsoever 
she has enough <MT>insulin</MT> to cover the meals cover her basal production 
when she moves to the next step she has intermittent <MT>hyperglycemia</MT> 
that refers to the fact that when she has large <MT>carbohydrate</MT> load an ice cream sundae for example <MT>blood sugar</MT> may go up into the she may get little flush 
she may have <MT>increased urine output</MT> because her <MT>glucose</MT> has exceeded the <MT>renal threshold</MT> of milligrams per deciliter 
but she ll have an extra cup of water may be be little bit thirsty and come right back down into the mid to low after that

sometimes little surprised by the answers get 
after all it seems to me asking very simple question 
what kind of <MT>diabetes</MT> do you have there are people that will know but surprising number don 
it not that they are stupid or uneducated 
it is that no one ever sat down and told them about their <MT>diabetes</MT> 
there are two main types of diabetes in those who aren pregnant 
they are simply called type and <MT>type ii diabetes</MT> 
while the end result is the same how they are obtained is very different 
type <MT>diabetes</MT> is an <MT>autoimmune disorder</MT> 
it is characterized by the <MT>blood sugars</MT> in the body being higher than normal 
this is due to an absence of <MT>insulin hormone</MT> that is produced in the <MT>pancreas</MT> 
<MT>insulin</MT> is responsible for pushing sugars that are in the <MT>bloodstream</MT> into the cell for proper use 
this <MT>hormone</MT> is deficient because the <MT>beta cells of the pancreas</MT> which are responsible for <MT>insulin</MT> production are destroyed by <MT>auto antibodies</MT> 
these are <MT>antibodies</MT> that are made by the body but actually cause destruction and do not serve to enhance the <MT>immune system</MT> 
type <MT>diabetes</MT> is <MT>disease</MT> of the young 
it peaks around years of age 
it is rare with an incidence in those at years of about per people 
non hispanic white youth have the highest incidence and african americans have the lowest incidence 
about children are diagnosed with it every year 
it usually presents either around age to or around age to and is more common in males 
there is some <MT>genetic predisposition</MT> to it but that is still being worked out 
it is thought that infectious agents like virus cause confusion to the <MT>immune system</MT> leading to these <MT>aberrant antibodies</MT> 
type <MT>diabetes</MT> has to be treated with <MT>insulin</MT> 
this makes sense as the problem is simply lack of <MT>insulin</MT> in the body 
therefore immediate <MT>insulin injections</MT> are needed although now there are <MT>apparatuses</MT> where <MT>insulin</MT> can be pumped into the body in selected individuals 
<MT>diabetes mellitus type ii</MT> is <MT>metabolic disorder</MT> that leads to <MT>high blood sugars</MT> 
however in <MT>type ii diabetes</MT> it is due to the resistance of <MT>body tissues</MT> to the action of <MT>insulin</MT> 
in most cases there is actually an overproduction of <MT>insulin</MT> but the <MT>insulin</MT> doesn seem to work very well 
<MT>type ii diabetes</MT> is brought on by <MT>obesity</MT> and sedentary lifestyle in many cases 
over of <MT>diabetics</MT> are <MT>type ii diabetics</MT> 
there about million cases united states and approximately of the population over the age of have it 
almost million new cases of this type of <MT>diabetes</MT> were diagnosed in <MT>type ii diabetes</MT> is very rare under the age of and it actually afflicts more women than men 
there is genetic tendency for it but only if <MT>obesity</MT> and sedentary lifestyle accompany those <MT>genes</MT> 
<MT>type ii diabetes mellitus</MT> can be treated with variety of different medication before having to go to <MT>insulin</MT> in selected cases 
oral medicationcan either further increase production of <MT>insulin</MT> or make the <MT>internal organs</MT> more sensitive to <MT>insulin</MT> 
however for some patients only getting <MT>massive doses of insulin</MT> to overcome the <MT>resistanceof the body organs</MT> to <MT>insulin</MT> can help properly treat <MT>type ii diabetes</MT> 
please see the other sections on how to treat <MT>diabetes</MT> 
pray for those who are afflicted with this terrible <MT>disease</MT>

transcript study published in the lancet leading international medical journal in august found that the risk of developing <MT>diabetes</MT> is increasingly rapidly among americans 
the study also found that this risk depends on your race your education and where you live and that <MT>diabetics</MT> are living longer 
this study is the first in more than decade to calculate the risk americans face of developing <MT>diabetes</MT> during their life time 
it was conducted by <MT>epidemiologists</MT> at the us centers for <MT>disease</MT> control and prevention in atlanta georgia who have been tracking and analysing the prevalence of <MT>diabetes</MT> and the rate at which news cases are diagnosed for many years 
these researchers used mortality data for almost persons from to years to assess the risk of developing type or type <MT>diabetes</MT> excluding <MT>gestational diabetes</MT> 
though the study only examined <MT>diabetes</MT> in the context of american people it is likely that similar results would have been obtained had the study been conducted using european data or data from other countries where western type diet and life style is the norm 
the ever increasing risk of <MT>diabetes</MT> the study revealed that there was dramatic rise between and in the overall risk that an american will develop <MT>diabetes</MT> 
in american boys had percent chance of developing <MT>diabetes</MT> and girls percent 
by however that risk had jumped to percent for both boys and girls 
in other words the risk for boys had almost doubled while the risk for girls had gone up percent 
the lancet study did not analyse why this is so 
but part of the reason could be the fact that people are living longer so that they have more years during which they can develop <MT>diabetes</MT> 
<MT>diabetics</MT> are living longer the good news is that america children diagnosed with <MT>diabetes</MT> can now expect to live more than years with the <MT>disease</MT> 
indeed between and the number of years for which men diagnosed with <MT>diabetes</MT> can expect to survive increased by percent 
for women the figure was percent 
though no explanation was given by the researchers this is probably due to advances in medical knowledge and treatments over the last years 
being <MT>diabetic</MT> shortens your life span 
over the year period examined by the researchers the average number of years lost due to <MT>diabetes</MT> for the population as whole increased by percent in men and percent in women 
this is obviously due to the increasing prevalence of <MT>diabetes</MT> 
it may also be partly due to the fact that there are probably fewer undiagnosed cases nowadays 
while the picture for the population as whole seems to be getting bleaker things are improving for the <MT>individual diabetic</MT> 
the number of years of his life man diagnosed with <MT>diabetes</MT> can expect to lose on average decreased by almost two years from to lost years between the and the end of the women also gained an average of two years their losses decreasing from to years over the same time span 
these improvements are probably due to better treatment regimes 
race gender and <MT>diabetes</MT> while americans overall have gloomy percent chance of developing <MT>diabetes</MT> the outlook for blacks and hispanics is much grimmer 
white boys have and white girls risk of <MT>developing diabetes</MT> 
by contrast the chances for black men are while for their sisters the risk is whopping 
the chances of <MT>developing diabetes</MT> for hispanic boys and girls are and respectively 
these figures which refer to the risks of <MT>developing diabetes</MT> reinforce the idea that <MT>diabetes</MT> has genetic origin at least to the extent that your <MT>genes</MT> can predispose you to <MT>diabetes</MT>
most medical researchers agree that it your life style that kicks it into action 
according to the researchers they analysed race because that was the data they had available but they did state that socio economic status is probably as important as if not more important than race 
nevertheless the risk of <MT>developing diabetes</MT> for whites is much less than it is for blacks and hispanics 
indeed the risk for white girls is third less than the risk for black and hispanic ladies 
as you can see hispanics of both sexes as well as black women have risk that exceeds percent 
but why black men have risk that is almost percentage points less than black women cannot be explained away by genetic differences 
education and <MT>diabetes</MT> the less educated you are the greater your risk of <MT>developing diabetes</MT> 
according to the lancet in the number of new diagnoses among high school drop outs was per thousand while among high school graduates it was and for those who studied beyond high school per thousand 
this figure for the number of new diagnoses of <MT>diabetes</MT> among high school drop outs high school graduates and those who continued to study after hi

designing new drugs would be easier if scientists understood the biology of the <MT>diseases</MT> they are trying to treat but for most common <MT>diseases</MT> which are caused by many different <MT>genes</MT> and environmental factors acting in concert gaining that understanding has been challenge 
in recent years however by studying the <MT>genomes</MT> of hundreds of thousands of people scientists have uncovered hundreds of genetic factors that influence disease risk including some <MT>genomic regions</MT> containing variants that either make people more prone to type <MT>diabetes</MT> or protect them from it 
many of the findings are upending what scientists thought they knew about the <MT>disease</MT> 
david altshuler will discuss how these discoveries can be translated into biological insights and inspiration for new treatments

diabetes</MT> refers to group of conditions characterized by high level of <MT>blood glucose</MT> commonly referred to as <MT>blood sugar</MT> 
too much <MT>sugar in the blood</MT> can cause serious sometimes life threatening health problems 
there are two types of <MT>chronic diabetic conditions</MT> type <MT>diabetes</MT> and type <MT>diabetes</MT> 
pregnant women may acquire transient form of the <MT>disease</MT> called <MT>gestational diabetes</MT> which usually resolves after the birth of baby 
<MT>pre diabetes</MT> is when the <MT>blood sugar level</MT> is at the borderline higher than normal but lower than in <MT>diabetics</MT> 
<MT>prediabetes</MT> may or may not progress to <MT>diabetes</MT> 
during food digestion <MT>carbohydrates</MT> or carb break down into <MT>glucose</MT> which is carried by the <MT>bloodstream</MT> to various <MT>organs of the body</MT> 
here it is either consumed as an energy source in <MT>muscles</MT> for example or is stored for later use in the <MT>liver</MT> 
<MT>insulin</MT> is <MT>hormone</MT> produced by <MT>beta cells of the pancreas</MT> and is necessary for <MT>glucose</MT> intake by <MT>target cells</MT> 
in other words when <MT>insulin</MT> is deficient muscle or <MT>liver cells</MT> are unable to use or store <MT>glucose</MT> and as result <MT>glucose</MT> accumulates in the <MT>blood</MT> 
in healthy people <MT>beta cells of the pancreas</MT> produce <MT>insulin</MT> <MT>insulin</MT> binds to its receptor on <MT>target cells</MT> and induces <MT>glucose intake</MT> 
in type <MT>diabetes</MT> beta cells of the pancreas are destroyed by the <MT>immune system</MT> by mistake 
the reason why this happens is unclear but genetic factors are believed to play major role 
<MT>insulin</MT> production is reduced less <MT>insulin</MT> binds to its receptor on <MT>target cells</MT> less <MT>glucose</MT> is taken into the cells more <MT>glucose</MT> stays in the <MT>blood 
type</MT> is characterized by early onset symptoms commonly start suddenly and before the age of type <MT>diabetes</MT> is normally managed with <MT>insulin injection</MT> 
type <MT>diabetics</MT> are therefore <MT>insulin dependent</MT> 
in type <MT>diabetes</MT> the <MT>pancreas</MT> produces enough <MT>insulin</MT> but something goes wrong either with <MT>receptor binding</MT> or <MT>insulin signaling</MT> inside the <MT>target cells</MT> 
the cells are not responsive to <MT>insulin</MT> and therefore cannot import <MT>glucose</MT> <MT>glucose</MT> stays in the <MT>blood</MT> 
in other words type <MT>diabetics</MT> are <MT>insulin resistant</MT> 
here again genetic factors <MT>predispose susceptibility</MT> to the <MT>disease</MT> but it is believed that lifestyle plays very important role in type typically <MT>obesity</MT> inactive lifestyle and unhealthy diet are associated with higher risk of type <MT>diabetes</MT> 
type is characterized by adult onset symptoms usually appear gradually and start after the age of type <MT>diabetes</MT> accounts for about to of all <MT>diabetics</MT> 
management focuses on weight loss and includes low carb diet

the mysterious onset of type <MT>diabetes</MT> may have to do with what in your <MT>genes</MT> 
studies of twins show that if one twin has type <MT>diabetes</MT> the other has to percent likelihood to also get the <MT>disease</MT>

in this video certified diabetes educator from mayo clinic explains the equipment and process for using <MT>glucagon</MT> for people with <MT>diabetes</MT> 
severe <MT>hypoglycemia</MT> or <MT>low blood sugar</MT> can be very serious and can caused when <MT>insulin</MT> and <MT>blood glucose</MT> are out of balance 
contributing factors can be too much <MT>insulin</MT> not eating enough food too much exercise or eating late 
for cases of severe <MT>hypoglycemia</MT> school nurses and trained staff may administer <MT>glucagon</MT> 
<MT>glucagon</MT> an important <MT>incretin</MT> plays big role in regulation of <MT>blood sugar</MT> and <MT>ketosis</MT> 
learn how by watching this video and learn more by following my blog at docmuscles com 
mrs <MT>foy</MT> explains how the <MT>hormones</MT> <MT>insulin</MT> and <MT>glucagon</MT> keep <MT>blood glucose levels</MT> in homeostasis 
in this lesson you will learn about how your <MT>blood glucose level</MT> is regulated or controlled by two important <MT>hormones</MT> <MT>insulin</MT> and <MT>glucagon</MT> via negative feedback system 
when you consume meal that is high in <MT>carbohydrates</MT> such as rice pasta and bread this will cause your <MT>blood glucose level</MT> to increase 
<MT>carbohydrates</MT> are essentially long chains of repeating <MT>glucose</MT> monomer units much like beads on necklace 
during digestion this is broken apart into <MT>glucose</MT> which absorbed into our <MT>bloodstream</MT> 
this increased <MT>blood glucose level</MT> causes <MT>gland</MT> known as the <MT>pancreas</MT> to secrete <MT>hormone</MT> called <MT>insulin</MT> 
remember that <MT>gland</MT> secretes <MT>hormones</MT> which act on specific <MT>target organs</MT> 
in this case the <MT>target organ</MT> is your <MT>liver</MT> which is stimulated to convert <MT>glucose</MT> to <MT>glycogen</MT> 
<MT>glycogen</MT> is basically long multi branched chains of <MT>glucose</MT> monomers stored in <MT>liver</MT> and <MT>muscle cells</MT> 
<MT>insulin</MT> also causes your <MT>body cells</MT> to uptake or take in <MT>glucose</MT> 
so this decreases your <MT>blood glucose level</MT> back to its optimal state 
when this system is faulty this leads to medical condition known as <MT>diabetes</MT> if you want to learn more about <MT>diabetes</MT> this will be addressed in another video 
the same response also occurs when you consume foods and drinks high in sugar such as sweets cakes and fizzy drinks 
when your <MT>blood glucose level</MT> drops such as when you are hungry the <MT>pancreas</MT> secretes <MT>hormone</MT> called <MT>glucagon</MT> 
like <MT>insulin</MT> the target <MT>organ</MT> for <MT>glucagon</MT> is also the <MT>liver</MT> though it stimulates the opposite process the breakdown of <MT>glycogen</MT> into <MT>glucose</MT> 
this increases your <MT>blood glucose level</MT> back to its optimal state 
so to review <MT>insulin</MT> and <MT>glucagon</MT> are two <MT>hormones</MT> released by the <MT>pancreas</MT> which act on the <MT>liver</MT> to regulate our <MT>blood glucose level</MT>

the <MT>fat burning</MT> <MT>hormone glucagon</MT> it important to have basic understanding of the <MT>fat burning</MT> <MT>hormones</MT> if you re having trouble losing weight or want to drop your <MT>body fat</MT> levels 
<MT>glucagon</MT> is one of the <MT>fat</MT> and sugar releasing <MT>hormones</MT> 
it works the opposite of <MT>insulin</MT> 
look at it like this <MT>insulin</MT> is the storage <MT>hormone</MT> and <MT>glucagon</MT> is the releasing <MT>hormone</MT> 
if you want to burn <MT>fat</MT> <MT>lipolysis</MT> you want your <MT>insulin</MT> to be low and <MT>glucagon</MT> to be high 
how to increase <MT>fat burning</MT> <MT>hormone</MT> 
long walks on an empty stomach when <MT>insulin levels</MT> are <MT>low fasting low carb diet low sugar</MT> eating an optimal amount of protein short high intensity training hit these <MT>hormones</MT> produce complex reactions in the body and there are many text books written about them 
to keep things simple however just look at <MT>insulin</MT> vs <MT>glucagon</MT> 
there is constant balancing act between the two <MT>hormones</MT> 
just keep your <MT>insulin levels</MT> low by limiting your <MT>sugary carbohydrates</MT> not eating too many meals in one day and staying active 
short high intensity training hit is also good for increasing <MT>glucagon</MT>

victoza liraglutide is <MT>glucagon like peptide</MT> <MT>glp receptor agonist</MT> indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve <MT>glycemic control</MT> in adults with type <MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> to reduce the risk of major <MT>adverse cardiovascular events</MT> in adults with type <MT>diabetes mellitus</MT> and established <MT>cardiovascular disease</MT> 
liraglutide is an analog of human <MT>glp</MT> and acts as <MT>glp receptor agonist</MT> 
the <MT>peptide</MT> precursor of liraglutide produced by process that includes expression of recombinant <MT>dna</MT> in saccharomyces cerevisiae has been engineered to be homologous to native human <MT>glp</MT> by substituting <MT>arginine for lysine</MT> at position liraglutide is made by attaching <MT>fatty acid</MT> <MT>palmitic acid</MT> with <MT>glutamic acid</MT> spacer on the remaining <MT>lysine</MT> residue at position of the <MT>peptide</MT> precursor 
liraglutide is an acylated human <MT>glp receptor agonist</MT> with <MT>amino acid sequence homology</MT> to endogenous human <MT>glp</MT> 
<MT>glp</MT> represents less than of total circulating endogenous <MT>glp</MT> like <MT>glp</MT> liraglutide activates the <MT>glp receptor membrane</MT> <MT>bound cell surface receptor</MT> coupled to <MT>adenylyl cyclase</MT> by the stimulatory protein gs in <MT>pancreatic</MT> beta cells 
liraglutide increases intracellular <MT>cyclic amp</MT> camp leading to <MT>insulin</MT> release in the presence of elevated <MT>glucose concentrations</MT> 
this <MT>insulin secretion subsides</MT> as <MT>blood glucose</MT> concentrations decrease and approach <MT>euglycemia</MT> 
liraglutide also decreases <MT>glucagon secretion</MT> in <MT>glucose dependent manner</MT> 
the mechanism of <MT>blood glucose</MT> lowering also involves delay in <MT>gastric emptying</MT>

<MT>trulicity</MT> contains <MT>dulaglutide</MT> which is human <MT>glp receptor agonist</MT> with <MT>amino acid sequence homology</MT> to endogenous human <MT>glp</MT> 
<MT>dulaglutide</MT> activates the <MT>glp receptor</MT> <MT>membrane</MT> <MT>bound cell surface receptor</MT> coupled to <MT>adenylyl cyclase</MT> in <MT>pancreatic beta cells</MT>

researchers at the university of cincinnati have discovered shot of medication used with <MT>weight loss surgery</MT> could make big difference in the results 
local liz bonis shares the details in today medical edge 
many people struggling with weight loss turn to surgery similar to the one doctors are performing here 
it called <MT>gastric banding</MT> 
band is placed around the <MT>gut</MT> to shrink the size of the stomach 
governor chris christie of new jersey just had this type of surgery 
he said it was to avoid <MT>gastric bypass major surgery</MT> which re routes the <MT>intestines</MT> 
the down side 
the <MT>gastric band</MT> is less effective than the roux en <MT>gastric bypass</MT> 
or at least is was until now 
kirk habegger is an <MT>obesity</MT> researcher who had theory about why this was true 
so every theory starts with hypothesis what started yours 
one of the key <MT>hormones</MT> that is changed during the <MT>bypass surgery</MT> the more invasive version is one that is <MT>hormone</MT> called <MT>glucagon like peptide</MT> one and it actually been utilized as <MT>therapeutic</MT> most people know it as <MT>byetta</MT> 
that right 
he recently found that this <MT>hormone</MT> known as <MT>glp</MT> one in the injectible drug for diabetes known as <MT>byetta</MT> can even out the results of these two surgeries 
in lab studies he found <MT>glp</MT> one with <MT>gastric banding</MT> enhances weight loss 
the <MT>hormone</MT> appears to help alter appetite 
so it sounds like in the end what you ve developed is still the result of eating less food 
it definitely suppresses the drive to eat 
the goal now is see if further studies show those who have this surgery can lose more weight with two therapies instead of one 
by combining the fda approved drug that we already have with the procedure that we already use hopefully we can have <MT>combination therapy</MT> that is just as effective and less invasive 
<MT>byetta</MT> does have side effects so right now further studies do need to be conducted to see what happens when this medication is used for long period of time with this <MT>weight loss surgery</MT> not just in lab studies but in people too

in this video discuss what is <MT>glucose</MT> the main functions of <MT>glucose</MT> in the body 
transcript what is <MT>glucose</MT> 
well <MT>glucose</MT> is <MT>molecule</MT> and it is known as <MT>monosaccharide</MT> which is the most basic unit of <MT>carbohydrate</MT> 
it is the key source of energy for all cells and <MT>organs in our bodies</MT> 
foods high in <MT>glucose</MT> include fruits veggies and grains 
desserts and candy contain lot of <MT>glucose</MT> as well 
many sweets have lot of added sugar in them and sugar is made up of <MT>glucose</MT> and <MT>fructose</MT> 
as mentioned before <MT>glucose</MT> is major source of energy in our bodies 
<MT>glucose</MT> is absorbed into the <MT>bloodstream</MT> rather quickly so it can provide quick energy to cells 
extra <MT>glucose</MT> can get stored as <MT>glycogen</MT> in the <MT>liver</MT> or <MT>muscles</MT> providing an energy reserve 
as with most substances in the body too much <MT>glucose</MT> can cause problems 
over consuming any type of food including foods with <MT>high glucose content</MT> can lead to <MT>obesity</MT> which in turn can lead to an increased risk of many diseases such as <MT>diabetes</MT> <MT>cardiovascular disease</MT> <MT>high blood pressure</MT> and even respiratory problems

if you are interested in more <MT>diabetes</MT> management tips get our guide here for all intents and purposes yes <MT>prediabetes</MT> is the same as igt or ifg 
they all mean the same thing 
at one point it was which test was used as to what the condition was called 
what you call something is kind of interesting isn it 
did you know it is now politically incorrect to call someone with <MT>diabetes</MT> <MT>diabetic</MT> 
now <MT>diabetic</MT> medications and <MT>diabetic</MT> foods are fine 
but many people who have <MT>diabetes</MT> actively resist being labeled as <MT>diabetic</MT> as if we were an illness 
correspondent writes what give as an example to doctors and other technical people is if person has <MT>hemorrhoids</MT> does that make that person one now personally am not offended one bit by the term diabetic if someone refers to me as that 
but have tried to be very careful in my video series to not use that term when describing people because it does offend some people and that just isn something want to do 
but terms in the world of <MT>diabetes</MT> have been developing and changing over the years 
here are some examples what used to be called <MT>juvenile diabetes</MT> or <MT>insulin dependent diabetes mellitus</MT> iddm is now referred to as type <MT>diabetes</MT>
the former terms <MT>adult onset diabetes</MT> or <MT>non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus</MT> <MT>niddm</MT> are now called type <MT>diabetes</MT> 
and there is no such thing as <MT>borderline diabetes</MT> 
if that what you think you have it is either <MT>pre diabetes</MT> or <MT>diabetes</MT> 
so what was once called <MT>impaired glucose tolerance</MT> or impaired fasting <MT>glucose</MT> is now <MT>pre diabetes</MT> or <MT>prediabetes</MT> 
there is even some controversy over there should be hyphen the reason given for this change was to show the seriousness of the condition 
the latest have found to be argued in the <MT>diabetes</MT> community is to change the name of <MT>prediabetes</MT> to stage type <MT>diabetes</MT> 
as many of you know many doctors and even insurance companies don recognize <MT>prediabetes</MT> as <MT>diabetes proper</MT> 
the movement to change the name to stage type <MT>diabetes</MT> is starting to gain <MT>ground</MT> 
this is one movement think could support 
it gives those with <MT>prediabetes</MT> more concrete idea of what they truly have 
but it also gives sense that just because they have <MT>prediabetes</MT> it will definitely become type which isn true

this video <MT>glucose tolerance test</MT> expected normal results is part of multimedia based module by francis yeboah knust and cary engleberg university of michigan 
this programme is intended as compendium of modules on <MT>procedures in clinical chemistry</MT> 
at present the only completed module is one concerning the conduct and interpretation of the <MT>glucose tolerance test gtt</MT> 
in gtt <MT>glucose</MT> is adminstered to the patient in order to determine how quickly it is cleared from the blood 
the test is usually used to test for <MT>diabetes insulin resistance</MT> and sometimes <MT>reactive hypoglycemia</MT> 
the <MT>glucose</MT> is most often given orally so the common test is technically an <MT>oral glucose tolerance test</MT> <MT>ogtt</MT>

all pregnant women should be screened for <MT>gestational diabetes</MT> around weeks <MT>gestation</MT> 
and it important to test for this because if woman has <MT>gestational diabetes</MT> or if she had previously diagnosed type or type <MT>diabetes</MT> if uncontrolled it can cause complications like <MT>preeclampsia</MT> <MT>blood sugar</MT> problems for the baby after delivery stillbirth and an abnormally large baby which has complications associated with that too 
to of women develop <MT>gestational diabetes</MT> and it all goes back to <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
<MT>insulin</MT> is the key that unlocks your <MT>body cells</MT> so that sugar can go inside and make the cells work 
and your body naturally becomes little more <MT>insulin resistant</MT> during pregnancy so that there enough sugar circulating in your blood</MT> so the baby gets what it needs 
normally mothers can compensate for this by producing more <MT>insulin</MT> but mothers who have <MT>gestational diabetes</MT> aren able to make more <MT>insulin</MT> and so <MT>blood sugar levels</MT> rise 
so testing like said for this is done are weeks and what will happen is the doctor will have you drink very sugary drink 
it contains grams of <MT>glucose</MT> 
and then they ll test your <MT>blood sugar</MT> an hour later and see how your body responded 
if you get value of to then you may have <MT>gestational diabetes</MT> and the doctor will want to do follow up test 
if the value you get on your first test is or higher then you just have <MT>gestational diabetes</MT> but they may still want to do follow up testing 
and in both cases it doing hour <MT>glucose tolerance test</MT> 
this is done when you re fasting and then you drink double the amount of sugar 
it gram <MT>glucose sugar</MT> drink 
and then they test your <MT>blood sugar</MT> every hour for hours and see what it is 
and then based on those values they determine if you truly have <MT>gestational diabetes</MT> or not 
if the diagnosis is made then there couple of different ways to manage it 
and it super important to keep your <MT>blood sugars under control</MT> so that you don have the complications discussed before 
the management plan is going to be dependent on how severe your case is 
and for lot of women it just involves some diet changes and exercise 
for other women it involves taking oral medication 
and for about of women with <MT>gestational diabetes</MT> it has to be controlled with <MT>insulin</MT> 
and you may start out just needing to make few diet changes and then as the pregnancy progresses so do your body needs and so do your baby needs and so that may change the plan as well 
so you could start out being diet controlled and then you may end up with oral medication or with <MT>insulin</MT> 
so this speaks of the importance of consistent monitoring 
<MT>diabetic</MT> educator will meet with you and talk to you about your treatment plan and also tell you how often you should be monitoring your <MT>blood sugars</MT> 
they ll take peek at your values each week and based on that determine if additional changes in your treatment plan are necessary
