Being vaccinated for COVID-19 protects you from becoming infected and possibly infecting those around you. COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration are being distributed by local states and communities, and they are free.
If you are eligible to be vaccinated for COVID-19, you are encouraged to do so as soon as possible. It is so important to get this vaccine when it's offered to you, says Dr. Melanie Swift, co-chair of the Mayo Clinic COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation and Distribution Work Group.
Even if you're healthy, even if you might not be at risk for complications from COVID-19 yourself. Dr.
Swift says being vaccinated for COVID-19 offers protection for you and others. Our society really needs everyone to be vaccinated so that we can stop transmission.
And that means the virus stops replicating.

Each week, Sapna and many other cancer patients, take an 8 hour overnight train journey in order to reach a hospital where treatment is affordable. CANCER, the worlds 2nd leading cause of death, is alarmingly prevalent in the farming region of Malwa in North-West India.
The region has seen such a fast growing number of cancer patients that it is known as the Cancer Capital of India.
Studies indicate excessive use of pesticides on food crops as the leading cause.
As a result, farmers and their families live in a cesspool of toxicity that also contaminates the water they drink and bathe in.The Acharya Tulsi Regional Cancer Hospital in Bikaner aims to provide underprivileged patients with free diagnosis, medication, overnight accommodations, and food.
However, the hospital receives over one thousand patients a day and only has seventeen doctors and a constant bed shortage. The filmmakers at Studio Birthplace were so moved by their experience in India, that they created a fund to help provide healthcare for cancer patients living below the poverty line in North-West India.

#VaccinEquity is a chance to send a signal to the future that we will do more together to make our populations healthy: 'Smokeless Chuhah' is a health initiative by Aarohi, an NGO based out of Kumaon, Uttarakhand, which is supported by Tata Trusts.
Traditionally, women of this region cook food on an open chulhah (stove) lit by firewood in kitchens that usually do not have windows or any outlets.
While cooking, these kitchens trap and hold all the smoke inside creating respiratory problems for the women who work in it.
Aarohi worked on developing and implementing widely the 'Smokeless Chulhah' , a modified mud chulhah that took all the smoke out of the kitchens.

The large scale vaccination efforts underway across the U.S. to vaccinate those eligible come at a time health care experts are concerned about people becoming lax about safety precautions. We are all worried that there's going to be a fourth wave, says Dr. Abinash Virk, an infectious diseases expert and co-chair of Mayo Clinic's COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation and Distribution workgroup.
We've had three waves already.
And each time the waves went down, everyone became very excited and took their masks off and stopped taking all the precautions that we recommended.
At this time, it is the same situation. Dr.
Virk says: We all want to get back to our normal lives.
But the recent data has shown that there's a slight uptick in the number of COVID-19 cases.
The most worrisome concern we now have is that during the last few days and weeks is that the variants have increased substantially, particularly in the East Coast, the Midwest and the Sunbelt areas.
The concern is that the fourth wave may be largely made of the COVID-19 variants especially since many people are still not vaccinated.
And that's the reason why we have to continue wearing masks in public, social distance and practice good hand hygiene until substantially more of the US population is vaccinated. For the safety of its patients, staff and visitors, Mayo Clinic has strict masking policies in place.
Anyone shown without a mask was recorded prior to COVID-19 or recorded in an area not designated for patient care, where social distancing and other safety protocols were followed.

But sometimes injections that are intended to promote health do the opposite.
This happens when they are given in an unsafe way using the same needle or syringe to give injections to more than one person.
Practices like this can lead to the transmission of life-threatening infections.

On this road, children's voices are heard.
Interspersed with laughter and screams echo of other voices, on the radio, on television.
They announce the State of Emergency in Angola and the number of people killed and infected by the Coronavirus in the world.
And in that same world of masks, there is an urgent word: WHY.
Whether it's a question, whether it's a statement, we don't know.
No one will come up with an answer. But the voices continue to echo.
They accompany the places, the voids, the silences that do not remain silent. Whether at school, on swings, or in the place where ghosts now live.
For those places of absence, where fear roars, where affections are crimes, the real emergency is in the eyes that the masks do not hide. Filmed in the middle of a State of Emergency, using only a smartphone, but hand in hand with the dream and reality, WHY does not seek to provide answers.
Only the commitment to resistance cinema, courage against fear.
To feel again that we are not alone.
That we are with others.

Kinyoun Memorial Lecture.Her talk, Antibodies Against Ebola and Lassa: A Global Collaboration, will explore the features of antibodies that protect against these deadly viruses and the ongoing need for scientists to collaborate in this research to establish a complete knowledge base.
During the past three years, VIC researchers from dozens of labs on five continents have studied these protective antibodies.
The VIC aims to fill critical knowledge gaps and provide a foundation of research that can be used to improve existing vaccines and antivirals, and to evaluate the pipeline of candidate countermeasures.Ollmann Saphire, who has served as VIC director since 2013, investigates the structural biology of both viruses and antibodieshow viruses like Ebola, Marburg and Lassa infect host cells, what the viruses weaknesses are, and which antibody combinations might defeat them.
This work has led to surprising and substantial discoveries in virology: Her team recently discovered that some viral proteins can change their 3D structures to play several different roles, allowing more information and more function to be encoded in concise viral genomes.Ollmann Saphire received her Ph.D. in Macromolecular and Cellular Structure and Chemistry from The Scripps Research Institute (SRI) in 2000.
She has since held a number of positions at TSRI, where she is currently a professor of Immunology and Microbial Science.
Her work has been recognized with a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers by the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, and young investigator awards from The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, the American Society for Microbiology, and the International Society for Antiviral Research.
She is a fellow of both the American Academy of Microbiology and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and serves on the Scientific Leadership Board of the Global Virus Network.Since 1979, NIAID has hosted an annual public lecture in honor of Dr. Joseph J. Kinyoun.
In 1887, Kinyoun founded the Laboratory of Hygienethe forerunner of NIHpaving the way for more than a century of groundbreaking medical discoveries since then.

Even with those recommendations the CDC continues to recommend not traveling unless it is essential.
Regardless, the CDC strongly recommends people continue to wear a face mask, practice social distancing and sanitize their hands. Meanwhile, COVID-19 vaccine research is continuing in teenagers.
The early data show equal safety in young people age 12 to 16, says Dr. Gregory Poland, an infectious diseases expert and head of Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group.
I think this is going to imply that, somewhere between this fall and Christmas, we're going to be able to offer the (COVID-19) vaccine to every age group. In this Mayo Clinic QA podcast, Dr. Poland answers a number of listener questions, including how long the COVID-19 vaccines are predicted to last and if the current transmission research still supports wiping down household items.
Dr. Poland also explains why someone who has had COVID-19 should still get a COVID-19 vaccine.  For the safety of its patients, staff and visitors, Mayo Clinic has strict masking policies in place.
Anyone shown without a mask was recorded prior to COVID-19 or recorded in an area not designated for patient care, where social distancing and other safety protocols were followed.

But at the same time, there are still people who need more information about the safety and the value of getting a COVID-19 vaccine, says Dr. Poland. While still hopeful, Dr. Poland says he's concerned herd immunity won't be reached in the U.S. through vaccination.
And that will mean more tragic deaths due to COVID-19 infection. My guess is, because we're such an interconnected global community until everybody's safe, none of us are safe.
And we're going to likely see continued circulation of the virus, and that virus will seek out whoever is not immune, says Dr. Poland.

It stirred surprise, in the colorless gray fog, when all struggles to survive, the garden buried in snow-heaps. I watched him twinge in the dim light before veering off to another place, beyond sight. For a moment, I stood waiting as if there was a chance he might return. And in that moment, I believed anything might be possible.

And Blacks, Latinos, and American Indians also represent a disproportionate number of cases.
Can you talk to us about some of the many factors that are driving these numbers? Something that has been discussed is that the idea of working from home, which is somethingthat I have the opportunity to do, is a privilege for a lot of people,and a privilege that a lot of people don't have.  Researchers are looking into possible associations between air pollution,which we know communities of color have higher exposures to, and COVID-19 susceptibility severity.
Do you think it could be a factor? Has enough been done to get information about COVID-19 out to minority communities,including the African-American community?  Do you think that the messaging has improved and that more people are being reached now? Do you have any idea where this myth arose that black people can't get COVID-19? What about distrust of the medical establishment in the black community?
Can you talk to us about whether you feel like that's had a bearing on the COVID-19 pandemic?  Are you concerned about  when we do have a vaccine if it will be available for minority communities?  Of the first 100 people in Chicago to die from COVID-19, 70 of them were black.
They didn't have faith in some of the lower resource safety net hospitalsin their neighborhoods, so they waited to go to the hospital until it was too late.

LaMontagne Infectious DiseasesRuntime: Description: Writing in his diary on September 27, 1918, Charles Corning, former mayor of Concord, New Hampshire, described how flu was blazing through his corner of the world as fire shrivels the fields, laying out communities and taking a toll of death unprecedented. The next day, he observed, A heavy sense of anxiety and apprehension like a dismal cloud in midsummer weighs heavily upon us because of the deadly ravages of the so-called Spanish influenza.
Funerals jostle one another so the sable procession goes on. That sable procession would eventually claim 167 lives in Concord and at least 50 million more around the globea toll of death unmatched by any other recorded disease outbreak before or since.This extraordinary pandemic and what scientists still can learn from it is the topic of the 2018 John Ring LaMontagne Memorial Lecture titled, The Mother of all Pandemics and Her Naughty Children: 100 Years of Behaving Badly, by Dr. David M. Morens, Senior Advisor to the Director, NIAID.
The lecture is scheduled for Tuesday, April 10 at 3 p.m. in Lipsett Amphitheater, Bldg.
10.In 2005, using preserved tissue from several 1918 flu victims, researchers determined the gene sequence of the strain of influenza A virus that sparked the pandemic and concluded that it was of avian origin.
But exactly how, when and where it made the jump to humans remains unclear.
The 1918 virus was deadlier than other known flu viruses and it killed a substantial proportion of people, those aged 20 to 40, who typically survive flu infectionsa phenomenon still not fully understood.
Moreover, not only was the virus inherently more damaging than other influenza viruses, it had a marked ability to partner with bacteria to cause severe, often fatal, pneumonia.
Morens will describe how research on 1918 flu virus and the pandemic it caused is informing current efforts to understand how and why new flu viruses with pandemic potential emerge.
He will also discuss investigations aimed at developing new and better flu vaccines, a major focus of NIAID research going into the second century of the 1918 pandemic era.The LaMontagne lecture honors contributions to NIH and public health made by Dr. LaMontagne during his three-decade career with NIAID.
LaMontagne earned international recognition and widespread admiration for his distinguished leadership and accomplishments in fighting emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.

For example, people living with and at risk of HIV often experience depression or other mental health conditions. When mental health conditions and HIV occur together, declining health is more likely, as is reduced HIV treatment adherence, drug-resistance, and community transmission.Several low-cost, evidence-based community mental health interventions exist which offer a proven, cost-effective way to prevent declining health due to the co-occurrence of these conditions.
WHO recommends that countries develop integrated services that tackle both mental health and HIV together.All vaccines could cause some degree of reaction, and the same is true for COVID-19 vaccines.
Post-vaccine symptoms are typically mild and resolve quickly without the need to use any medication. Common COVID-19 vaccine side effects include: Redness or soreness at injection site. Muscle aches. Fatigue. Headache. Fever or chills. For some people, the second dose in a COVID-19 vaccine series is causing a stronger reaction and more side effects than the initial dose.
The same was true during clinical trials.  For the safety of its patients, staff and visitors, Mayo Clinic has strict masking policies in place.
Anyone shown without a mask was recorded prior to COVID-19 or recorded in an area not designated for patient care, where social distancing and other safety protocols were followed.

Dr. Gregory Poland, an infectious diseases expert and head of Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group, says that's understandable with new information and data being released each day. For instance, people are wondering what type of medications they can take if they're being vaccinated for COVID-19.
There are also concerns about whether a person who has been vaccinated for COVID-19 can transmit the virus.
And some are asking why they need to wait 14 days, before and after being vaccinated for COVID-19 vaccine, if they are scheduled to be given a different vaccine, such as a shingles vaccine. In this Mayo Clinic QA podcast, Dr. Poland answers these questions and a variety of other listener questions.

For example, participants wearing VR headsets were asked to navigate a virtual distance of approximately 90 m under daytime conditions in a city area modeled on Hong Kong.
This video illustrates a comparison of the VR performance of a patient with glaucoma during simulated daytime conditions (A) and nighttime conditions (B).
The patient took 85.1 seconds in the daytime navigation with 2 collisions vs 167.8 seconds with 1 collision in the nighttime navigation.
The performance suggests that VR simulations can help eye care professionals better understand from patients' perspective how visual impairment impairs them in their daily lives.

I respond immediately to health emergencies, whether they are caused by disease outbreaks or disasters.  I do research on the distribution and patterns of diseases or health events and their risk factors for populations, I lead epidemiological research studies, working directly in the field or providing coordination support at the central level.
The process of interviewing individuals or patients, identifying patterns, and making recommendations that have an impact on the well-being of a population or group of people, is deeply rewarding to me.  Something that was personally relevant was the emergency response to yellow fever in Angola in 2016.
We had limited resources; however, as a multiagency team, we were able to stopin a matter of weeksthe spread and export of the disease to other continents, and we contributed to generating innovative vaccination strategies against yellow fever.  Ive had an interest in public health and epidemiology since I was very young and lived in San Salvador, El Salvador.  My mother worked for a public health and preventive medicine department.
And my father was an emergency communication volunteer.
I grew up witnessing the impact of humanitarian aid and community service. I began my career with CDC at the Center for Global Health and then continued as an Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer.
 If I were not an epidemiologist, perhaps I would have a career in music, because I am a classical flute player.
I guess I would play in an orchestra; I would be a music critic or a theater or orchestra manager.

However, discussion is ongoing as to whether people who are immunocompromised, such as patients undergoing cancer treatment, or people who have autoimmune diseases, should be vaccinated for COVID-19. Both of those categories (of people) should be vaccinated, says Dr. Gregory Poland, an infectious diseases expert and head of Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group.
Those are not contraindications.
Those are indications to get the vaccine. He adds that research is ongoing, but current information demonstrates the benefits far outweigh the theoretical risks. In this Mayo Clinic QA podcast, Dr. Poland talks about vaccine hesitancy, and patients who are immunocompromised or have autoimmune conditions.
Also, he discusses next steps in the journey to vaccinate children for COVID-19.
And he reviews recent guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Control about in-person gatherings.  For the safety of its patients, staff and visitors, Mayo Clinic has strict masking policies in place.

The outbreak was contained due to the tireless efforts of local teams, the support of partners, the generosity of donors, and the effective leadership of the Ministry of Health.Within hours of the outbreak being declared on 8 May, WHO released US$2 million from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies, deployed a team to augment capacity in the field, and activated an emergency incident management system.
In total, more than 360 people were deployed by WHO to respond to the outbreak.
During the response, traditional methods such as case investigation, contact tracing and providing care to the sick were combined with a new tool: an Ebola vaccine.Looking to the future, WHO urges the DRC Government and the international community to build on the positive momentum generated by the quick containment of the Ebola outbreak to tackle other outbreaks the country is facing, such as cholera and polio.More information about Ebola:FDA discusses regulatory strategies to show API sameness of complex APIs in generic drug product.Presenter: Bapu R.

Penicillin is one of the oldest known antibiotic.
The syphilis bacterium has not been shown to have developed resistance to penicillin in the past.
So penicillin is very effective in the treatment of syphilis especially in pregnancy.
Penicillin crosses the placenta and treats the baby in the womb better than most other known antibiotics.
This ability of penicillin to cross the placenta makes it a very good treatment option for syphilis during pregnancy.
One shot of the injection can cure the disease both for the pregnant lady and the baby in her womb.
Penicillin in the right dosage can be given to non-pregnant women, babies and to men also, if they test positive for syphilis.

Patients with COVID-19 are at risk for neurologic complications, including encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain. This is a very serious condition; encephalitis can lead to coma and death, says Sebastian Lopez, M.D., a Mayo Clinic neurologist.
Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are critical for achieving better neurologic outcomes.
Diagnosing the exact cause of encephalitis is important because treatments vary, depending on whether patients have an underlying infection or a reaction caused by the immune system. Despite significant progress, encephalitis is still associated with high mortality.
Those who recover from the initial illness may struggle with fatigue, paralysis, language impairment, personality changes and memory problems that may persist for months or permanently.  For the safety of its patients, staff and visitors, Mayo Clinic has strict masking policies in place.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.
Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads.
Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so its important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

Not only would it lead to millions more unnecessary deaths, it would also lead to a significant number of people facing a long road to full recovery. Herd immunity is only possible with safe and effective vaccines that are distributed equitably around the world.
Until we have a vaccine, governments and people must do all that they can to suppress transmission, which is the best way to prevent post-COVID long-term effects.

Practices like this can lead to the transmission of life-threatening infections.

I analyze data on the cost of conditions, from ADHD and autism to hemophilia and spina bifida.
I also study ways to improve peoples health who have these conditions.
  I have a special passion for newborn screening, which is a public health success story, because it saves babies and money!
In 2011, HHS recommended that states screen newborns for critical congenital heart defects using a simple, noninvasive test.
As part of that recommendation, CDC studied the costs and assessed the cost-effectiveness of screening.
Later, after screening was widely adopted, I worked with others to use national data on births and deaths to look at the number of deaths avoided in states that had adopted the HHS recommendation.
We found that infants born after states required screening had a one-third lower risk of dying from heart defects.
More than 100 lives are saved each year as a result of this screening.

This guidance doesn't translate as well into the workplace, where the vaccination statuses and high-risk health conditions of co-workers aren't public knowledge, says Dr. Melanie Swift, co-chair of Mayo Clinic's COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation and Distribution Work Group.  For the safety of its patients, staff and visitors, Mayo Clinic has strict masking policies in place.
Anyone shown without a mask was recorded prior to COVID-19 or recorded in an area not designated for patient care, where social distancing and other safety protocols were followed.

Ebola virus disease (formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever) is a severe, often fatal illness, with a case fatality rate of up to 90%.
It is one of the worlds most virulent diseases.The infection is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected animals or people.
Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care.
During an outbreak, those at higher risk of infection are health workers, family members and others in close contact with sick people and deceased patients.Ebola virus disease outbreaks can devastate families and communities, but the infection can be controlled through the use of recommended protective measures in clinics and hospitals, at community gatherings, or at home. More information:NAHospitals need ways to make rational fair decisions about who gets ICU beds and ventilators if COVID-19 patients overwhelm capacity.
Douglas B.
White, MD, MAS, Director of the Program on Ethics and Decision Making in Critical Illness at the University of Pittsburgh, discusses a framework for making those decisions.
Originally streamed Friday March 27 at 12 noon CDT (GMT-5). Read the Viewpoint by Dr White:the proposal summary at:Free CME for watching this video is available atCoronavirus Resource page from the JAMA Network:discussed in this interview: Could you say a bit about your co-author, Bernard Lo?
 You're an ethicist and an intensivist.
How did you combine these two disciplines?
 The focus today will be on ventilators and critical care beds.
But how do you think about rationing in the broader sense?
 Categorically excluding large groups of patients from receiving mechanical ventilation Is ethically problematic  It is ethically insufficient to solely focus on survival to hospital discharge  Were there other models that you drew on besides the lung allocation scoring system?
 Recommendations for a multiprinciple allocation framework  More guidance is needed on withdrawing life support from one patient to provide it to another  In ICUs, after someone's been on a ventilator for a long period of time, there are decisions made about how long they should remain on a ventilator.
Are these situations different?
 Can you talk more about this framework that you've helped develop?
 Do you know if any of this approach has been used in Italy?
 I have enormous respect for Maurizio Cecconi, MD and what he has been going through in Italy  So how is this document being used at this moment?
 Creation of triage teams  Allocation criteria for ICU admission/ventilation  What happens if you have 3 patients with acute respiratory failure but only 1 ventilator.
(Secondary criteria) Reassessment for ongoing provision of critical care/ventilation  Different cultures and religions view these issues differently.
How does this framework address that?
 How do you think about the rationing of tests and personal protective equipment (PPE)?
 Do you have a sense of why such a large number of health care workers are getting infected.
 Is it ethical to double ventilate on a single ventilator knowing that this might be harmful to some patients?
 Hospitals and nursing homes are limiting visitors.
Will families be able to visit patients dying of COVID-19 in ICUs?

Originally broadcast on Wednesday, April 1, 2020 at  CST (GMT-).Free CME for watching this video is available atCoronavirus Resource page from the JAMA Network:discussed in this interview:  Introduction  Say you have 100 patients come into the hospital with COVID-19.
It looks like about a third end up in the intensive care unit.
How do they do once they're in the intensive care unit? There's been some tension about early intubation versus waiting.
Do you want to comment on that or just not enough information? There are reports of people who are developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and deteriorating very quickly.
Do you have a sense of that in your ICU? There's been some reports that for the people who get intubated they appear to stay on mechanical ventilation for a longer period of time than people's other experience with ARDS but again, this is observational information. Case-fatality once you're intubated is high.
From looking at the various reports, talking to your colleagues, do you have a sense of what it is?  As someone who runs a lot of ICUs, what's your greatest fear? What's your sense of the clinical trials?
Where will they be successful?
Should they be tried in very sick people or is the goal to try some of them in less sick people to prevent those people from needing the intensive care unit? Do you have a sense -is it going to be the antivirals, is it going to be this so-called cytokine storm that we can intervene with, will it be chloroquine?
Do your instincts tell you that there is going to be a big gain with one of these new therapies?  Do you understand the exuberance around chloroquine?  Are there any clinical trials focused on preventing mildly ill patients from needing ICU care or have most of them been focused on the more ill patients?  Visitation is remarkably limited and their loved ones are dying and are going to die.
Either they're on a ventilator or they've been appropriately extubated to spend their last few hours in comfort.
How do you imagine that playing out in the US? How soon do you think we'll get results from the randomized trials?  What is the primary outcome in most of the trials?  Would you use one ventilator for two patients if ventilators are scarce?  What do you think the 900,000 physicians who aren't intensivists need to know?Earn Free CME credits by watching JAMA Livestreams and completing a brief questionnaire.

For people infected with COVID-19, what do we know about their immunologic response? Has science advanced enough so that we'll know what their immunologic response looks like?  Will it be safe to bring people back to college campuses?
Or to have large meetings again?  Can you see a future that would involve forms of passive immunization or convalescent serum?  This is an RNA virus.
Does that affect vaccine development?  Do you think that it will be like influenza (which usually wanes in the spring and summer) in that we will see more cases in the fall? Can individuals get reinfected?  Should children still receive their immunizations? What about adults and immunizations?
Would you change the recommendations for adults over the next 3-6 months?  Do you have a sense of what the next few months are going to look like?  How prepared are we at this moment?

Against the backdrop of a busy research laboratory, Craig learns that lots of progress has been made and momentum gained in the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis thanks to collaboration among partners as well as increased awareness and commitment from poor and rich countries alike, spurred by the link between tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS: tuberculosis is the leading infectious killer of people living with HIV. Two key challenges mentioned by Dr Moyo are the need for sufficient funding to develop an effective vaccine and the need for tuberculosis patients to complete their course of treatment (which lasts 6 months or more) to keep the medicines effective: incomplete treatment will lead to the tuberculosis bacteria becoming drug-resistant.
While people are aware that they should finish treatment, she explains, it's a complicated scenario; there are many things that come into playWe need understand where they are coming from.
They are people with lives, with families. Despite her laboratory surroundings Dr Moyo remains very aware of the real-life implications of her research:It's not only about the documents that you read, any nice brochures, it's not about the presentations that you make tuberculosis affects real people, real families and real communities.20 November is World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims, this video is a message from Dr Etienne Krug, Chair of the UN Road Safety Collaboration.

Similar increases are also reported from Sri Lanka, India and a few other countries with a subtropical or tropical climate.
Among the plausible causes are the use of nephrotoxic agrichemicals or the exposure to high temperatures at work in the context of a climate change scenario. Research aiming at understanding this enigmatic disease and identify etiology and preventive measures has been ongoing.
However, efforts to understand the social determinants of wellbeing and quality of life, as well as issues around health care access are also equally important, since this disease means for many of them a death sentence at a very young age and has an important socioeconomic impact in their families and communities. This documentary based on a Photovoice research project puts the affected people and communities at the center, and wants to raise their voices and experiences so this mysterious disease receives more attention from the international global health community, particularly by reclaiming a more fair and equal access to health care and social protection measures, as well as health promotion and preventive actions within their communities. *** Durante los ltimos 20 aos, Centroamérica ha experimentado un aumento dramtico de la enfermedad renal crnica, inexplicable por factores de riesgo convencionales, que afecta principalmente a los trabajadores varones del sector agrcola.

Entre las causas plausibles se encuentran el uso de agroqumicos nefrotxicos o la exposicin a altas temperaturas en el trabajo en el contexto de un escenario de cambio climtico. Se han realizado investigaciones destinadas a comprender esta enigmtica enfermedad e identificar la etiologa y las medidas preventivas.
Sin embargo, los esfuerzos para comprender los determinantes sociales del bienestar y la calidad de vida, as como los problemas relacionados con el acceso a la atencin médica, también son igualmente importantes, ya que esta enfermedad significa para muchos de ellos una sentencia de muerte a una edad muy temprana y tiene un impacto socioeconmico importante.

And for anyone who receives the Moderna or Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines, two doses are required to complete the series and be fully vaccinated. The CDC released a study earlier this year that revealed nearly 5% of the people who received the first dose of those vaccines did not receive the second dose within the recommended interval21 days for Pfizer and 28 days for Moderna. In order to get the maximum protection that's been demonstrated in the trials, we know that you're not considered fully protected until two weeks after your second dose of vaccine.
And so that's why we really encourage everyone to make sure they get that second dose in, says Dr. Nipunie Rajapakse, a Mayo Clinic pediatric infectious diseases specialist.  For the safety of its patients, staff and visitors, Mayo Clinic has strict masking policies in place.

The disease spreads primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or speaks.
These droplets are relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink to the ground.
People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these droplets from a person infected with the virus.

The Declaration of Alma-Ata, endorsed at that conference, formed the foundation for the last 40 years of global primary health care efforts.
This October, the world will reunite to reinvigorate and recommit to primary health care.
The Global Conference will endorse a new declaration which emphasizes the critical role of primary health care around the world, refocusing efforts to ensure that everyone everywhere is able to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health. At its heart, primary health care is about caring for people, rather than simply treating specific diseases or conditions.
PHC is usually the first point of contact people have with the health care system.
It provides comprehensive, accessible, community-based care that meets the health needs of individuals throughout their life.

With this type of immunotherapy, T cells are extracted from the patient and modified in a laboratory to express the chimeric antigen receptor, which allows the cells to better recognize and fight cancer.
The modified cells are then expanded to large numbers and returned the patient through an IV to begin attacking the cancer.

?Burkitt lymphoma: a model of polymicrobial carcinogenesis and global oncology Air date: Friday, March 6, 2015,  Category: NIH Director's SeminarsRuntime: Description: NIH Director's SeminarIt has been just over 50 years since the description of Burkitt Lymphoma (BL) as an unusual tumor affecting jaws of African children.
Seminal discoveries linked to BL includ Epstein-Barr virus, the first human virus linked to a human cancer, the linkage of BL to Plasmodium falciparum malaria, chromosomal translocations involving c-myc and immunoglobulin promoter elements, and demonstration of rapid and curative response to chemotherapy.
Dubbed the Rosetta stone of cancer, BL became a complex model for carcinogenesis involving poly-microbes, immunity and host-genetics.Fifty years later, many fundamental questions remain unanswered.
Why BL occurs in a small fraction of people chronically exposed to malaria and/or EBV, the risk conveyed by infections singly or jointly, the specific malaria or EBV proteins involved, and whether EBV or malaria have high-risk variants for BL and the pathogen-host interactions involved in BL.
In addition, we do not know how to prevent or adequately treat BL.
The lecture will dissect the epidemiology of BL, particularly in Africa.
It will explore the inherent difficulties quantifying the association of malaria, EBV, and other exposures in human populations in an effort to summarize the strength and weaknesses of the evidence linking EBV and malaria to BL.
Borrowing from malaria diagnostic and vaccine studies, the lecture will explore new approaches to quantify risks of association with specific pathogen proteins and insights into pathways potentially exploited to increase or decrease the risk of BL.
It will also highlight the potential of proteomics and genomics technologies to slingshot discoveries in BL.
Finally, the lecture will offer a panoramic view of BL as a complex model for carcinogenesis and highlight the critical nature of multidisciplinary and international collaboration to engage and build capacity for pediatric oncology research in developing countries where BL is endemic.Permanent link:Meet Nadia Routson, one of our mammography technologists at Johns Hopkins Medical Imaging.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.
Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads.
Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so its important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

Antimicrobial resistance:aspects in sustainable development goals:in emergencies:information:to this video: Scott Holmes -Im an economist in CDCs Center for Global Health.  My general interest in economics started when I was a child and wanted to fight poverty.
 I got interested in health when I was getting my PhD from Rand and got involved in studies that use preventive care to improve the health of the population.  At CDC, I analyze data to see if a policy or intervention related to vaccination in poor countries is cost-effective.
  Vaccines prevent diseases and save costs.
  My job is to estimate the costs and the benefits.  The results of these evaluations contribute to extending the use of vaccines where they are needed and effective, and help us to control and prevent diseases.
  I do most of my work at my desk.
  However, sometimes I go into the field to collect data, train in-country teams about health economics, and help countries use economic information in their public health decisions.  For example, I evaluated the cost of an intervention referring children for birth registration and vaccinations in rural Zambia, and I estimated the cost of typhoid fever in countries with high disease rates such as Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan to inform decisions about the value of introducing typhoid vaccines in specific contexts.  My work at CDC is exciting.
  It allows me to apply my economic knowledge to help stop the spread of diseases through vaccination and improve the health of people around the world.

WHO is working with the Danish authorities on research and control efforts. It is normal for viruses to mutate or change over time.
But each time a virus goes from humans to animals and back to humans, it can change more.
Thats why these reports are concerning. Scientists have not yet noted changes to the mink-related strain of the COVID-19 virus identified in Denmark that affect transmissibility, disease severity or reinfection in people.
But further evidence is needed. Major variations to the virus might impact on vaccines, therapeutics and treatments.
Since the start of the pandemic, WHO has worked with researchers, evolutionary virologists, sequencing teams, and synthetic biologists to track genetic changes in the #COVID19 virus.

For example, in a nighttime stair navigation task, participants were asked to walk up and then down 2 flights of stairs.
This video illustrates the VR performance of a healthy individual (A) and a patient with glaucoma (B) in the task.
The healthy individual took 179.5 seconds to complete the navigation with 0 collisions, and the patient with glaucoma took 465.1 seconds with 3 collisions.
The performance suggests that VR simulations can help eye care professionals better understand from patients' perspective how visual impairment impairs them in their daily lives.

A new study of survey data finds that only a minority of parents choose not to immunize their children against the sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV) due to concerns that vaccination would encourage or support youth sexual activity, a reason frequently cited by doctors as a barrier to advocating for this vaccine.
Instead, the results show, parental concerns that steer young people away from vaccination tend to focus on safety worries, lack of necessity, knowledge about HPV and absence of physician recommendation, according to Johns Hopkins researchers who led the investigation. The findings, published in the November issue of the Journal of Adolescent Health, could help public health officials and professional societies develop new interventions to increase rates of HPV vaccination.Today is the start of something great, says MD Anderson President Peter WT Pisters of plans for MD Anderson Cancer Center and the Houston Dynamo to work together to end cancer.Effective Jan. 1, MD Anderson will be the the official cancer center and jersey partner of Houston's Major League Soccer (MLS) team.

However, a type of immunotherapy called T-cell therapy improves T cells potential to destroy cancer.With this type of immunotherapy, T cells are removed from the patients body and sent to a lab where many copies of these T cells are made.
Sometimes these T cells are modified to be even more effective at fighting cancer.
These improved T cells are then returned to the patients body, where they can launch a more powerful attack against the cancer.

The cell's control center, the nucleus, houses the DNA and sends all sorts of RNAs, proteins and other messages to direct the rest of the cell.
These materials pass back and forth through the nuclear pore complex.
The researchers found that a mutated tau protein can gum up the nuclear pore machinery and block movement of materials in and out of the nucleus, which can kill the neuron.
This ultimately can lead to Alzheimer's disease.

While the infection spreads among persons of all ages, older persons and those with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death from COVID-19.
Symptomatic individuals in their seventies are twenty times more likely to require hospitalization than young adults, and case fatality rates suggest a notable increase in risk after age 60, with progressively worse outcomes at older ages.
Less visible but no less worrisome are the broader effects: health care denied for conditions unrelated to COVID-19; neglect and abuse in institutions and care facilities; an increase in poverty and unemployment; the dramatic impact on well-being and mental health; and the trauma of stigma and discrimination.
As the pandemic spreadsacross low, middle and high income countries, the needs of older persons may also differ, and severe disease and mortality rates for older persons may increase even further if fragile health and social protection systems are overwhelmedThis campaign was produced by the WHO country office in Cambodia for the Ministry of Health of Cambodia and other partners.

He speaks about the Global Strategy Post-2015 for the fight against Malaria.For some people, the second dose in a COVID-19 vaccination series is causing a stronger reaction and more side effects than the initial dose.
That was also true during the clinical trials. This may be a concern not only for those experiencing side effects, but also those who are worried a COVID-19 vaccine isn't working because they didn't have a reaction. Dr.
Melanie Swift, co-chair of Mayo Clinic's COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation and Distribution Work Group, says all vaccines could cause some degree of reaction.
The same is true with the COVID-19 vaccines. They do provoke an immune reaction, which can cause symptoms, says Dr.
Swift.
That shouldn't be confused with being harmful or being unsafe.
It's what the vaccine is intended to do.  For the safety of its patients, staff and visitors, Mayo Clinic has strict masking policies in place.

More information19In 2019, International Medical Corps and National Geographic teamed up to bring Photo Camp to a group of young Somali refugees from Melkadida Refugee Camp in Ethiopia.
Picture: Hope documents the week-long experience, capturing the joy of self-expression and highlighting the impact of supporting positive mental health. The years between childhood and adulthood are critical to learning, discovering and developing a sense of ones self in the world.
But in Melkadida refugee camp, located in a desert on the Ethiopia/Somalia border, young people have few options or opportunities.
Many families have spent the better part of a decade at the camp, where there is nowhere to go and little to do. Some schooling is available to young refugees, but many children cannot attend because of responsibilities in the home or limited family resources.
And children with physical, intellectual or mental health and behavioral challenges are often kept home, viewed as difficult to accommodate, or due to family fears about bullying and stigmatization.
This separation from peers can cause a young person to become isolated, and can create or exacerbate mental health issues at a foundational time in life.
Interventions that promote positive mental health can have a profound positive impact on long-term individual and community outcomes.
International Medical Corps has been at the camp since 2011 providing mental health and psychosocial support services..

In response to these alarming figures, WHO publishes its first World Suicide Report and gives a message of hope: suicides are preventable.
Effective strategies exist and await their implementation.
This includes the restriction of access to the most common means, including pesticides, firearms and certain medications, but also responsible reporting of suicide by the media to avoid sensationalizing it and providing information on where to seek help.
As mental disorders and harmful use of alcohol contribute to many suicides around the world, early identification and effective management by health workers are key to ensuring that people receive the care they need.
Communities also play a critical role.
They can provide social support to vulnerable individuals and engage in follow-up care, fight stigma and support those bereaved by suicide.

(2014-2018).Melinda Gates, co-Chair of the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation addresses delegates at the World Health Assembly, 20 May 2014. Ms Gates then highlighted ways to improve the health of mothers and newborn babies,emphasizing the value of linking efforts to improve reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health  the continuum of care. She pointed out that: If women can plan their families, they are more likely to space their pregnancies.
If they space their pregnancies, they are more likely to have healthy babies.
If women's babies are healthy, they are more likely to flourish as children.
When mothers have healthy pregnancies, and when children thrive, the positive benefits last a lifetime. She also called on delegates to pay more attention to newborn babies.
Although there has been remarkable global progress in reducing the number of children dying before their fifth birthdays, neonatal mortality rates have declined at a slower pace.
The Health Assembly will discuss a new action plan for newborns later this week.
Ms Gates and other panellists at today's technical briefing discussed quality of care around childbirth and its potential to end preventable deaths of mothers and newborn babies and stillbirths, generatinga triple return on investment.Kevin and I met at CDC, as members of the Epidemic Intelligence Service Class of 2011.

Findings:In this network meta-analysis that includes 236 trials with 176310 participants, the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 agonists was significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality compared with the control groups (placebo or no treatment) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80, and HR, 0.88, respectively) and with DPP-4 inhibitors (HR, 0.78, and HR, 0.86, respectively). Meaning:In patients with type 2 diabetes, the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 agonists was associated with better mortality outcomes than DPP-4 inhibitors.Dressed in pink, Sylvana, who is only five days old, lies in her mothers arm.
Her mother, Joséphine Ekoli, 28 is happy that she gave birth to a healthy baby after recovering from Ebola.
Ekoli was infected with the virus and admitted to an Ebolatreatment centre in Beni, Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is supported by the World Health Organization in December 2018.Historically, there have been very low survival rates for pregnant women infected with Ebola, and for their babies.
Babies born to mothers with Ebola are usually born already infected with the virus.
These infants almost always die.
In this outbreak, however, because of pediatric care of infants, there have been several who have survived.

On Friday, Oct. 21, MD Anderson League City showcased a hot air balloon in the shape of a pink ribbon in the night-time balloon glow and wash the area in soft blush light.
The popular Ballunar Festival was the Texas debut of the unique hot-air balloon.We hope our pink ribbon hot air balloon will honor the thousands of breast cancer survivors in our Bay Area community, remind us of those we've lost and encourage every woman to be educated and appropriately screened for breast cancer, says Matthew Ballo, M.D., professor of Radiation Oncology at the center.
Ballo, who has been at the center since it opened in 2007, is part of a multidisciplinary team of MD Anderson physicians caring for patients diagnosed with breast cancer. MD Anderson physicians and staff were on hand during the event to pass out free educational materials and pink glow necklaces to spread the light of breast cancer awareness and hope. According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women.
In 2010, an estimated 207,090 new breast cancer cases were diagnosed in women in the United States, and about 2,000 new breast cancer cases in men.
As with all cancers, early detection of breast cancer is key to the best outcome. MD Anderson League City is located on the UTMB Health League City Campus.
As MD Anderson's first comprehensive clinical cancer center to open outside of the Texas Medical Center, the facility provides medical oncology; surgery; radiation oncology, including accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI); chemotherapy infusion; pain management; social and support services and nutritional counseling.

I believe that Minnesotans deserve fair and accurate information about vaccines. Last month, Klobuchar sent a letter to social media companies urging them to stop the spread of false and misleading information related to COVID-19 vaccines.
In response, at least one company implemented more rigorous policies to help counter coronavirus and vaccine-related misinformation.  For the safety of its patients, staff and visitors, Mayo Clinic has strict masking policies in place.

Ive always loved science, and specifically the interplay between the brain and human behavior.
Luckily for me, I learned early on that the best scientists are often those who dont limit their interests to a narrow field of research, but rather look for multiple approaches in areas to work in.
So I left academia, switched from neuroscience to public health, and became a disease detective in CDCs Epidemic Intelligence Service program.
The EIS program allowed me to travel the globe to work on preventing the leading causes of injury and to detect disease outbreaks and stop their spread.
I helped in a surveillance of fatal motor vehicle crashes in Thailand, a country that ranks second highest for rates of road traffic injury deaths in the world.
I also worked on a surveillance of Zika virus infection among pregnant women, opioid overdose, marijuana impaired driving, and now traumatic brain injury.
By assisting other countries and states, I help keep Americans safe and healthy, a CDC goal.

Guterres said, I think its important to say that all countries and this is now a problem that is affecting many countries in the worldall countries must do everything to be prepared and all countries must do everything respecting naturally the principle of non-discrimination, without stigmatization, respecting human rights; doing everything that they can to contain the disease. Although it was still possible to contain the disease if some fail, if some do not do everything that is needed, this can still become out of control with dramatic consequences for global health and the global economy, he warned. Speaking in Geneva at WHO headquarters, Guterres reiterated his strong appeal to countries to assume their responsibilities and knowing that they can fully count on WHO to support them in that effort.IPPCR 2019 Issues in Randomization Part 3 of 4 Air date: Tuesday, October 1, 2019,  Category: IPPCR Runtime:  Description: The Introduction to the Principles and Practice of Clinical Research (IPPCR) is a course to train participants on how to effectively conduct clinical research.

Kinyoun Memorial Lecture on the intersection between the national opioid crisis and the management of infectious diseases.Titled, Opioids: Epidemic of Our Time and Impact on Infectious Disease, Dr. Redfields talk will explore the impacts of the unprecedented use of opioids in the United States on the management of infectious diseases.
While overdose remains the leading cause of death among people who use opioids, this population is also disproportionately affected by viral hepatitis, bacterial endocarditis, HIV and other infections associated with sharing and reusing needles to inject drugs and other behaviors linked to illicit drug use.The opioid epidemic presents substantial challenges to controlling infectious disease transmission.
In the United States, new hepatitis C infections increased by 223 percent from 2010 to 2016, and one in 10 new HIV infections occurs in people who inject drugs.
Dr. Redfield will discuss the roles that federal public health partners including CDC and NIH can play in addressing this crisis.Dr. Redfield became the 18th CDC director and the administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry in March 2018, capping more than three decades of leadership in public health, research and clinical care with a focus in virology.
After receiving his medical degree from Georgetown University in 1977, Dr. Redfield rose to the rank of Colonel at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where he led some of the earliest clinical studies enrolling people with AIDS.
He later became a co-founder of the University of Marylands Institute of Human Virology.The annual Kinyoun Lecture commemorates Dr. Joseph J. Kinyoun who, in 1887, founded the Laboratory of Hygiene, the institution that later would become NIH.
Since 1979, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has invited distinguished guests to present their work in the fields of infectious diseases and immunology for this lectureship.For more information go toAuthor: Robert R.

Prioritizing investment in these strategies will save lives. The road safety package can be accessed here:  a virus is widely circulating in a population and causing many infections, the likelihood of the virus mutating increases.
The more opportunities a virus has to spread, the more it replicatesand the more opportunities it has to undergo changes. Stopping the spread at the source remains key.
Current measures to reduce transmissionincluding frequent hand washing, wearing a mask, physical distancing and avoiding crowded places or closed settingscontinue to work against new variants by reducing the amount of viral transmission and therefore also reducing opportunities for the virus to mutate.OR nurse Rebecca Jones is also a trained ballerina.

In most cases, the disease is transmitted to humans by the bite of a rabid dog, but infection can also spread through scratches or via saliva. Rabies kills one person every 9 minutes and children aged 514 years are frequent victims. Yet rabies is 100% vaccine preventable.
Vaccinating dogs is the most cost-effective way to prevent rabies in people. Education about dog behaviour, immediate care measures after a bite, responsible dog ownership and bite prevention are essential components of rabies elimination. WHO and partners aim to achieve zero human rabies deaths by2030. The time to act is now.

Globalization, conflict, poverty, urbanization, inequality and poor job prospects are among the reasons that compel people to leave their homes in search of a better future for themselves and their family.
Despite many benefits of migration, migrants themselves remain among the most vulnerable members of society. Governments face the challenge of integrating the health needs of migrants into national plans, policies andstrategies as recommended by resolution WHA61.17 on the Health of Migrants adopted in 2008.
Urgent action is required to ensure the migrants right to health and to implement migrant-sensitive health policies thatincorporate universal health coverage and equitable access to quality health services regardless of the migrants legal status. WHO is working with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), among others, to tackle the health needs and improve the health status of migrant populations while managing the possible health impacts on the affected local populations.
WHO and its regional offices have provided support to Member States in developing and implementing policies aimed at enhancing the role of the health sector in responding to the needs of migrant and affected local populations.
This technical briefing will review the current situation and priorities related to migration and health, review best practices and look at lessons learnt and implications for the future of WHOs work in relation to migration and health.

How many coronavirus vaccines are there in development, and how far along are some of them?  So there appears to be four different types of vaccines being developed.
Do companies bet on one type, or do they develop more than one type?  How large are phase two trials in comparison to phase three trials?  What committees do you sit on?  Human challenge trials  Does that approval of human challenge trials rest with the FDA?  Are there any robust, larger phase two trials ongoing?
What is the timeline for those trials?  What happens if there's little disease over the summer?
How does that impact these trials?  When do you begin to accrue meaningful data from that these studies? Will there be a distribution of ages in terms of people who are vaccinated for these studies? So over the summer, we begin to accrue more information,but how valuable that information is will depend upon how much disease is in the area where people have been vaccinated.
Is that an accurate statement? Do they just add more and more numbers to the initial phase three trial if there's simply not enough disease?  Will a vaccine be 100% effective?  What is Operation Warp Speed?  Mass producing the vaccine while coronavirus trials are ongoing.  Does America's investment in a vaccine then entitle the US to own that vaccine or some portion of that vaccine? Do you have any sense of how the issue of equity will play out in the US and other countries?  With Operation Warp Speed, do you anticipate that a successful phase three trial will lead to 300 million doses a few months later?  Vaccine-hesitancy  Political pressure on the FDA to approve a vaccine  What will be the mechanism that will lead to FDA approval of a vaccine?  Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are examples of why we need randomized clinical trials for COVID-19 treatments.  Why are we optimistic about a vaccine that's 1) a first-of-a-kind mRNA vaccine and 2) a first-of-a-kind coronavirus vaccine? Which vaccine will be made under Operation Warp Speed?  For the phase three trials to start in July,are there plans to recruit enhanced numbers of Latinx and African Americans -who are known to have higher infectious rates for whatever reason? Are persons with conditions that might put them at greater risk from a vaccine autoimmune conditions, pregnant women will they be excluded from the safety testing?  The Sweden experiment  What would a second wave without a vaccine look like in the fall?  Closing comments about vaccines and COVID-19?Editors' Notes:Overwhelming scientific evidence supports the benefits of vaccines over their harms and risks when used at a population level to prevent disease.
Seefor a discussion.

Plus dinformations:When Shopna's husband became sick the family depleted all it's available resources for his remedy.
In the end he couldn't be saved. Shopna has since less than three Euros a day to live, feed her two children and provide them with proper education.
A challenge that she has in common with 80 million others in Bangladesh. Thanks to the efforts of local NGOs and their German fundraiser Shanti, Shopnas situation has changed for the better.
In order to showcase how beneficial these projects are we gave this extraordinary woman the opportunity to tell her story: How she has slipped into abject poverty by great misfortune and a lacking health system, and that now she is determined to fight her way back. Shopna's Story has originally been told in order to promote the work that various NGO's in Bangladesh do in order to help people escape poverty. But the question why she has slipped into poverty is an essential part of the film. Her story shows that poverty is not determined by the one mistake you make but rather a set of various social-economic factors like a proper health system, economic resiliance, well being and a stable social security net. In Shopna's case it becomes evident that a lacking health system and insufficient resources can lead to catastrophic outcomes.

We have never been closer to achieving our goal; but there is much still to be done to secure a polio-free world.Once wild polio has been eradicated, the only risks of the virus returning would come from rare strains of circulating vaccine derived polioviruses, and from potential leaks of the virus from laboratories or vaccine manufacturers.
This series of videos will explain the work being done to address these risks: from the vaccines that are being used to stop polio; to how the oral polio vaccine is being phased out from April 2016 to remove any risk of vaccine-derived polioviruses, starting with the switch from trivalent to bivalent oral polio vaccine in April 2016; and how securely containing polioviruses within laboratories and vaccine manufacturing sites will keep every last child protected, long into the future.Find out more at www.polioeradication.orgGrowing up in a nurturing family environment is important for every childs development and well-being.

No one knows that better than Andrea Beckendorf.At 49 years old with no known risk factors for breast cancer, Andrea decided to schedule a regular mammogram during a global pandemica decision that may have saved her life. Because of the cancer's small size, location and density of her breast tissue, Andrea's doctors told herAfter the biopsy at her local clinic in Iowa, Andrea came to Mayo Clinic and started a care plan with Dr. Daniela Stan. Dr.
Stan says because the cancer was caught early, the prognosis is good, and her treatment was very straightforward.
In January, Andrea had a lumpectomy. Partial breast radiation means Andrea only needs five days of radiation versus 15 days.
She also won't need chemotherapy. Because of the quick diagnosis and straightforward treatment, Andrea has been able to get back to her music much faster.  For the safety of its patients, staff and visitors, Mayo Clinic has strict masking policies in place.

This animated short musical features 3 elderly birds: an ailing Owl, a physically challenged Tui, and a couple of isolated Korean Godwits who sing about challenges of mobility, loneliness, and self-reliance.
The film has been a collaboration between Professor Merryn Gott and Dr Lisa Williams from the University of Aucklands School of Nursing and Associate Professors Sarina Pearson and Shuchi Kothari from Media and Communication.Funded by MBIEs Ageing Well National Science Challenge, Professor Gott and Dr Williams conducted interview-based research on issues of social isolation and loneliness among New Zealands elderly.
They approached Drs.
Pearson and Kothari who devised a funny, touching animated short film that could live on social media, in policy rooms, and on the film festival circuit.
Kothari and Pearson chose animation because they believedthat anthropomorphic animals and birds in particular have a great capacity to communicate powerful ideas more concisely than live-action characters.
After reviewing more than 200 pages of interview material while scripting Elder Birdsong, the research was clearthese were not self-pitying old people.
They were resilient, engaged and eloquently pointed out the systemic social structural problems that contributed to their sense of isolation and loneliness.
To reflect the inclusiveness of the nursing research, 3 bird characters were created.
Yukfoo Animation designed the birds and brought the characters to life on a very tight budget.
In terms of voice-work there was a strong commitment to casting culturally appropriate performers for the respective birds.
Rima Te Wiatas rendition of the elderly Tui is a testament to the power of voice in animation.
Musician Marshall Smiths composition of the melody elevated the films lyrics and high school teacher Margarets willingness to take her singing from her classroom into the studio gave our Pakeha Owl real sincerity.
The Korean non-actors that voiced the Godwits had never sung outside of the shower!

.Air date: Thursday, November 12, 2020 Duration 01 :02 :08 Category: Special NIH History Lecture As the ground war in Vietnam escalated in the late 1960s, the US government leveraged the so-called doctor draft to secure adequate numbers of medical personnel in the armed forces.
Among newly minted physicians few alternatives to military service was the Clinical Associate Training Program at the National Institutes of Health.
Though only a small percentage of applicants were accepted, the elite program launched an unprecedented number of remarkable scientific careers that would revolutionize medicine at the end of the twentieth century.Medal Winners recounts this overlooked chapter and unforeseen byproduct of the Vietnam War through the lives of four former NIH clinical associates who would go on to become Nobel laureates.
Raymond S. Greenberg traces their stories from their pre-NIH years and apprenticeships through their subsequent Nobel Prizewinning work, which transformed treatment of heart disease, cancer, and other diseases.
Greenberg shows how the Vietnam draft unintentionally ushered in a golden era of research by bringing talented young physicians under the tutelage of leading scientists and offers a lesson in what it may take to replicate such a towering center of scientific innovation as the NIH in the 1960s and 1970s.

Serologic testing cant yet tell if individuals are immune to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
But population testing, by quantifying the number of people who have had an antibody response to infection, can help determine whether to maintain or relax strict public health measures on the way toward protective herd immunity.

Prior to the discovery of hepatitis C in 1989, people in the United States may have been exposed to the infection through blood contact during routine dental or medical procedures.
Anyone who may have been exposed to blood via unregulated tattoos or piercings, injection or intranasal drug use, or high risk sexual practices is at risk of hepatitis C infection.
Persons born between 1945 and 1965 (Baby Boomers) as well as those at risk of blood exposure should be tested for hepatitis C. Treatment is highly effective in curing more than 95% of those who finish the recommended course of therapy.

Today we'll be talking about one of our Moon Shot ProgramsOur two guests today are Dr. Jim AllisonChairman of Immunology here at MD Anderson and Dr. Pam Sharmawho is an Associate Professor in GU Medical Oncology and also the Scientific Director of Immunotherapy Platform.
Dr. Allison's work that he brought to MD Anderson is really helping us make great strides in immunotherapy in this instance for melanomaH: Dr. Sharma, as the Director of the Immunotherapy Platform, obviously you're building the basis for trials and studies and then the translational research into the clinic, tell us more about your flexible clinical trial design.
How important was that in dovetailing with Dr. Allison's work? Dr.
Sharma: So I think we all wanted to understand what were the immune responses and the patients.
So if you took the brakes off, if you block CTLA4 and you enhance T-cell responses, what did that look like?
What does that mean?
How are the T-cells now changed so that they can start to attack the cancer cells?
Because the basic thinking is that the immune system exists within all of us.
We all have the same immune system.
The immune system can protect us from viral or bacterial antigens, also from cancer antigens as Jim was mentioning.
So why does the cancer then grow if we have this immune system and this immune response there?
So really we could understand that the immune system was becoming not capable of functioning in the same way because the tumors learn how to evade the immune response.
Also the immune system was not really having the effect that we needed it to have because it had all of these brakes, these inhibitory signals like CTLA4 and PD1 affecting it.
So if you gave an antibody to block, then you could take off those signals, but once you remove the inhibitory signals, what did the T-cells really do?
Why was it that only some patients could respond to the therapy and not others?
If we learned something from the ones who are responding, could we then apply it to the patients who are not responding initially and then get them to respond to the therapy as well?
That way you can have more and more patients.So then you're trying to understand what's going on and it's hard to get tumor tissues in that setting because they have metastatic disease and it's not easy to give biopsies and it's not easy to grow enough T-cells out of the small biopsies.
So we designed a clinical trial where patients with localized disease, these are patients with early stage disease who are scheduled for surgery.So these patients participate in what we term the pre-surgical clinical trials in that they got some of the drug, they went to surgery and we were able to now take all of their tumor tissues at the time of surgery to ask what are the T-cells doing in these tumors?
How are they different from patients who didn't get the drug?
So it's important because we had another cohort of patients who went directly to surgery as they normally would without participating on the protocol and that was the comparison group to see how did the untreated versus treated look in terms of a immune response that's occurring within the tumor and by that way we can start to identify potential mechanisms or markers and in this setting we identified a marker known as i-clos, where we were able to say this is probably an important player in why these immune responses are occurring and then Jim and I collaborated to actually show that was true in mouse models and now hopefully we can start to think of how to bring target of i-clos back to the clinic for patients again.
So it was a 12-patient clinical trial that first pre-surgical trial in bladder cancer patients and from 12 patients we could learn a lot because we had the tumor tissues and the blood and so it really provided us with mechanistic details that I don't think that in 800-patient trials where all you're getting is blood gives you the same kind of understanding.
So we're big proponents with immunotherapy platform of trying to not only think of your Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials, which we're all used to, but also thinking of these small mechanism based trials, these 10-20 patient trials to really understand how do these drugs work either as monotherapy or in combination with other things.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.
Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads.
Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so its important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow). Learn more:For people living with depression, talking about it can be the first step towards recovery.
In this short video, James Chau, news presenter and WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Sustainable Development Goals and Health, speaks of his personal experience of depression, and what helped him recover.This video was produced for WHOs Depression: lets talk campaign which runs from October 2016 for one year.
Depression is also the theme of World Health Day 2017, which will be marked on 7 April.For more information:#LetsTalkThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released guidelines to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection at youth summer camp.
But what do those guidelines mean for families and children who look forward to the ritual of attending overnight or day summer camp? There not one strategy that's going to completely eliminate risk.
But using multiple strategies can reduce the risk for everyone who's attending, says Dr. Nipunie Rajapakse, a pediatric infectious diseases physician. Some of the strategies include trying to limit the size of the camp as much as possible so that it's a smaller group of childrenmaybe with one camp counselor or supervisor rather than having large groups of children mixing.Testing prior to attending camp one to three days before camp starts is another strategy that can help reduce the risk of someone coming to the camp who's infected and going on to transmit to others, says Dr. Rajapakse.
And, certainly, if anyone is feeling ill or having symptoms in any way, they should not be attending.  For the safety of its patients, staff and visitors, Mayo Clinic has strict masking policies in place.
Anyone shown without a mask was recorded prior to COVID-19 or recorded in an area not designated for patient care, where social distancing and other safety protocols were followed.

But thanks to groundbreaking immune checkpoint blockade research led by Jim Allison, Ph.D., winner of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, we have a new way to treat cancer: immunotherapy.
Rather than treating the cancer directly, immunotherapy trains the immune system to attack cancer. With immunotherapy, MD Anderson is able to effectively treat bladder cancer, head and neck cancers, Hodgkins lymphoma, kidney cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma.
And through clinical trials, were expanding immunotherapy to treat more types of cancer and exploring more types of immunotherapy every day.

Despite the great medical benefits there are concerns about the potential future cancer risks from CT and other higher dose imaging tests such as nuclear medicine cardiac stress tests.Dr. Berrington's Radiation Epidemiology Branch conducted the first study to directly assess the cancer risks after CT scans in a historical cohort study of 200,000 children in the UK.
Dr. Berrington will discuss the first results from this study and also present risk projections for the number of future cancers in the US that may be related to diagnostic imaging in children and adults if use continues at current levels.
Recently a number of new screening tests such as lung CT and CT colonography have been proposed for use in the general population, and newer radiotherapy techniques like proton therapy have become more widespread.
Dr. Berrington will also describe work that she has conducted that assesses the balance of the potential benefits against the radiation-related cancer risks for these emerging technologies.Permanent link:The next five years are critical for the world to stay on track to deliver health and well-being for all people and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
