Kinyoun - Infection and Immunity Runtime:  Description: Joseph J. Kinyoun Memorial Lecture 2017 Dr. Erica Ollmann Saphire, director of the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Immunotherapeutic Consortium (VIC), will deliver the 2017 Joseph J. Kinyoun Memorial Lecture.
Zzy-BCMCed8 $$$ Her talk, Antibodies Against Ebola and Lassa: A Global Collaboration, will explore the features of antibodies that protect against these deadly viruses and the ongoing need for scientists to collaborate in this research to establish a complete knowledge base.
Zzy-BCMCed8 $$$ During the past three years, VIC researchers from dozens of labs on five continents have studied these protective antibodies.
Zzy-BCMCed8 $$$ The VIC aims to fill critical knowledge gaps and provide a foundation of research that can be used to improve existing vaccines and antivirals, and to evaluate the pipeline of candidate countermeasures.
Zzy-BCMCed8 $$$ Ollmann Saphire, who has served as VIC director since 2013, investigates the structural biology of both viruses and antibodieshow viruses like Ebola, Marburg and Lassa infect host cells, what the viruses weaknesses are, and which antibody combinations might defeat them.
Zzy-BCMCed8 $$$ This work has led to surprising and substantial discoveries in virology: Her team recently discovered that some viral proteins can change their 3D structures to play several different roles, allowing more information and more function to be encoded in concise viral genomes.
Zzy-BCMCed8 $$$ Ollmann Saphire received her Ph.D. in Macromolecular and Cellular Structure and Chemistry from The Scripps Research Institute (SRI) in 2000.
Zzy-BCMCed8 $$$ She has since held a number of positions at TSRI, where she is currently a professor of Immunology and Microbial Science.

m7cEbyylWqs $$$ The Mother (of all Pandemics) and Her Naughty Children: 100 Years of Behaving Badly Air date: Tuesday, April 10, 2018, Category: John R. LaMontagne - Infectious Diseases Runtime:  Description: Writing in his diary on September 27, 1918, Charles Corning, former mayor of Concord, New Hampshire, described how flu was blazing through his corner of the world as fire shrivels the fields, laying out communities and taking a toll of death unprecedented. The next day, he observed, A heavy sense of anxiety and apprehension like a dismal cloud in midsummer weighs heavily upon us because of the deadly ravages of the so-called Spanish influenza.
m7cEbyylWqs $$$ Funerals jostle one another so the sable procession goes on. That sable procession would eventually claim 167 lives in Concord and at least 50 million more around the globea toll of death unmatched by any other recorded disease outbreak before or since.
m7cEbyylWqs $$$ This extraordinary pandemic and what scientists still can learn from it is the topic of the 2018 John Ring LaMontagne Memorial Lecture titled, The Mother of all Pandemics and Her Naughty Children: 100 Years of Behaving Badly, by Dr. David M. Morens, Senior Advisor to the Director, NIAID.
m7cEbyylWqs $$$ The lecture is scheduled for Tuesday, April 10 at 3 p.m. in Lipsett Amphitheater, Bldg.
m7cEbyylWqs $$$ 10.
m7cEbyylWqs $$$ In 2005, using preserved tissue from several 1918 flu victims, researchers determined the gene sequence of the strain of influenza A virus that sparked the pandemic and concluded that it was of avian origin.
m7cEbyylWqs $$$ But exactly how, when and where it made the jump to humans remains unclear.
m7cEbyylWqs $$$ The 1918 virus was deadlier than other known flu viruses and it killed a substantial proportion of people, those aged 20 to 40, who typically survive flu infectionsa phenomenon still not fully understood.
m7cEbyylWqs $$$ Moreover, not only was the virus inherently more damaging than other influenza viruses, it had a marked ability to partner with bacteria to cause severe, often fatal, pneumonia.
m7cEbyylWqs $$$ Morens will describe how research on 1918 flu virus and the pandemic it caused is informing current efforts to understand how and why new flu viruses with pandemic potential emerge.
m7cEbyylWqs $$$ He will also discuss investigations aimed at developing new and better flu vaccines, a major focus of NIAID research going into the second century of the 1918 pandemic era.
m7cEbyylWqs $$$ The LaMontagne lecture honors contributions to NIH and public health made by Dr. LaMontagne during his three-decade career with NIAID.
m7cEbyylWqs $$$ LaMontagne earned international recognition and widespread admiration for his distinguished leadership and accomplishments in fighting emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.

oy8n2_ZrNbA $$$ Ive been at CDC for 22 years.
oy8n2_ZrNbA $$$ Since 2001, Ive been a health economist with the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities.
oy8n2_ZrNbA $$$ I analyze data on the cost of conditions, from ADHD and autism to hemophilia and spina bifida.
oy8n2_ZrNbA $$$ I also study ways to improve peoples health who have these conditions.
oy8n2_ZrNbA $$$ I have a special passion for newborn screening, which is a public health success story, because it saves babies and money!
oy8n2_ZrNbA $$$ In 2011, HHS recommended that states screen newborns for critical congenital heart defects using a simple, noninvasive test.
oy8n2_ZrNbA $$$ As part of that recommendation, CDC studied the costs and assessed the cost-effectiveness of screening.
oy8n2_ZrNbA $$$ Later, after screening was widely adopted, I worked with others to use national data on births and deaths to look at the number of deaths avoided in states that had adopted the HHS recommendation.
oy8n2_ZrNbA $$$ We found that infants born after states required screening had a one-third lower risk of dying from heart defects.
oy8n2_ZrNbA $$$ More than 100 lives are saved each year as a result of this screening.
oy8n2_ZrNbA $$$ I love my job because CDC has given me the opportunity to apply my education in economics and public health to real world problems and solutions!

uDicsP3femI $$$ It is one of the worlds most virulent diseases.The infection is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected animals or people.
uDicsP3femI $$$ Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care.
uDicsP3femI $$$ During an outbreak, those at higher risk of infection are health workers, family members and others in close contact with sick people and deceased patients.
uDicsP3femI $$$ Ebola virus disease outbreaks can devastate families and communities, but the infection can be controlled through the use of recommended protective measures in clinics and hospitals, at community gatherings, or at home.More information:

3xEsnPHPOfg $$$ ()You're an ethicist and an intensivist.
3xEsnPHPOfg $$$ How did you combine these two disciplines?
3xEsnPHPOfg $$$ ()The focus today will be on ventilators and critical care beds.
3xEsnPHPOfg $$$ But how do you think about rationing in the broader sense?
3xEsnPHPOfg $$$ ()Categorically excluding large groups of patients from receiving mechanical ventilation Is ethically problematic ()It is ethically insufficient to solely focus on survival to hospital discharge ()Were there other models that you drew on besides the lung allocation scoring system?
3xEsnPHPOfg $$$ ()Recommendations for a multiprinciple allocation framework ()More guidance is needed on withdrawing life support from one patient to provide it to another ()In ICUs, after someone's been on a ventilator for a long period of time, there are decisions made about how long they should remain on a ventilator.
3xEsnPHPOfg $$$ Are these situations different?
3xEsnPHPOfg $$$ ()Can you talk more about this framework that you've helped develop?
3xEsnPHPOfg $$$ ()Do you know if any of this approach has been used in Italy?

3xEsnPHPOfg $$$ (Secondary criteria) ()Reassessment for ongoing provision of critical care/ventilation ()Different cultures and religions view these issues differently.
3xEsnPHPOfg $$$ How does this framework address that?
3xEsnPHPOfg $$$ ()How do you think about the rationing of tests and personal protective equipment (PPE)?
3xEsnPHPOfg $$$ ()Do you have a sense of why such a large number of health care workers are getting infected.
3xEsnPHPOfg $$$ ()Is it ethical to double ventilate on a single ventilator knowing that this might be harmful to some patients?
3xEsnPHPOfg $$$ ()Hospitals and nursing homes are limiting visitors.
3xEsnPHPOfg $$$ Will families be able to visit patients dying of COVID-19 in ICUs?

c7s3fS6RTlQ $$$ It looks like about a third end up in the intensive care unit.
c7s3fS6RTlQ $$$ How do they do once they're in the intensive care unit?
c7s3fS6RTlQ $$$  There's been some tension about early intubation versus waiting.
c7s3fS6RTlQ $$$ Do you want to comment on that or just not enough information?
c7s3fS6RTlQ $$$  There are reports of people who are developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and deteriorating very quickly.
c7s3fS6RTlQ $$$ Do you have a sense of that in your ICU?
c7s3fS6RTlQ $$$  There's been some reports that for the people who get intubated they appear to stay on mechanical ventilation for a longer period of time than people's other experience with ARDS but again, this is observational information.
c7s3fS6RTlQ $$$  Case-fatality once you're intubated is high.
c7s3fS6RTlQ $$$ From looking at the various reports, talking to your colleagues, do you have a sense of what it is? As someone who runs a lot of ICUs, what's your greatest fear?
c7s3fS6RTlQ $$$  What's your sense of the clinical trials?
c7s3fS6RTlQ $$$ Where will they be successful?
c7s3fS6RTlQ $$$ Should they be tried in very sick people or is the goal to try some of them in less sick people to prevent those people from needing the intensive care unit?
c7s3fS6RTlQ $$$  Do you have a sense - is it going to be the antivirals, is it going to be this so-called cytokine storm that we can intervene with, will it be chloroquine?
c7s3fS6RTlQ $$$ Do your instincts tell you that there is going to be a big gain with one of these new therapies? Do you understand the exuberance around chloroquine? Are there any clinical trials focused on preventing mildly ill patients from needing ICU care or have most of them been focused on the more ill patients? Visitation is remarkably limited and their loved ones are dying and are going to die.
c7s3fS6RTlQ $$$ Either they're on a ventilator or they've been appropriately extubated to spend their last few hours in comfort.
c7s3fS6RTlQ $$$ How do you imagine that playing out in the US?
c7s3fS6RTlQ $$$  How soon do you think we'll get results from the randomized trials? What is the primary outcome in most of the trials?

oOgFYh7Ywo4 $$$  Has science advanced enough so that we'll know what their immunologic response looks like? Will it be safe to bring people back to college campuses?
oOgFYh7Ywo4 $$$ Or to have large meetings again? Can you see a future that would involve forms of passive immunization or convalescent serum? This is an RNA virus.
oOgFYh7Ywo4 $$$ Does that affect vaccine development? Do you think that it will be like influenza (which usually wanes in the spring and summer) in that we will see more cases in the fall?
oOgFYh7Ywo4 $$$  Can individuals get reinfected? Should children still receive their immunizations?  What about adults and immunizations?

s-Sbt5sgAuc $$$ Against the backdrop of a busy research laboratory, Craig learns that lots of progress has been made and momentum gained in the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis thanks to collaboration among partners as well as increased awareness and commitment from poor and rich countries alike, spurred by the link between tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS: tuberculosis is the leading infectious killer of people living with HIV.Two key challenges mentioned by Dr Moyo are the need for sufficient funding to develop an effective vaccine and the need for tuberculosis patients to complete their course of treatment (which lasts 6 months or more) to keep the medicines effective: incomplete treatment will lead to the tuberculosis bacteria becoming drug-resistant.
s-Sbt5sgAuc $$$ While people are aware that they should finish treatment, she explains, \"it's a complicated scenario; there are many things that come into playWe need understand where they are coming from.
s-Sbt5sgAuc $$$ They are people with lives, with families.\"Despite her laboratory surroundings Dr Moyo remains very aware of the real-life implications of her research: \"It's not only about the documents that you read, any nice brochures, it's not about the presentations that you make tuberculosis affects real people, real families and real communities.\"

caoj0dAkK08 $$$ During the last 20 years, Central America has seen a dramatic increase of chronic kidney disease, unexplained by conventional risk factors, which primarily affects male workers in the agricultural sector.
caoj0dAkK08 $$$ Similar increases are also reported from Sri Lanka, India and a few other countries with a subtropical or tropical climate.
caoj0dAkK08 $$$ Among the plausible causes are the use of nephrotoxic agrichemicals or the exposure to high temperatures at work in the context of a climate change scenario.Research aiming at understanding this enigmatic disease and identify etiology and preventive measures has been ongoing.
caoj0dAkK08 $$$ However, efforts to understand the social determinants of wellbeing and quality of life, as well as issues around health care access are also equally important, since this disease means for many of them a death sentence at a very young age and has an important socioeconomic impact in their families and communities.This documentary based on a Photovoice research project puts the affected people and communities at the center, and wants to raise their voices and experiences so this mysterious disease receives more attention from the international global health community, particularly by reclaiming a more fair and equal access to health care and social protection measures, as well as health promotion and preventive actions within their communities.***Durante los ltimos 20 aos, Centroamérica ha experimentado un aumento dramtico de la enfermedad renal crnica, inexplicable por factores de riesgo convencionales, que afecta principalmente a los trabajadores varones del sector agrcola.

hG957jTdf0g $$$ Burkitt lymphoma: a model of polymicrobial carcinogenesis and global oncologyAir date: Friday, March 6, 2015, Category: NIH Director's Seminars Runtime:  Description: NIH Director's Seminar It has been just over 50 years since the description of Burkitt Lymphoma (BL) as an unusual tumor affecting jaws of African children.
hG957jTdf0g $$$ Seminal discoveries linked to BL includ Epstein-Barr virus, the first human virus linked to a human cancer, the linkage of BL to Plasmodium falciparum malaria, chromosomal translocations involving c-myc and immunoglobulin promoter elements, and demonstration of rapid and curative response to chemotherapy.
hG957jTdf0g $$$ Dubbed the Rosetta stone of cancer, BL became a complex model for carcinogenesis involving poly-microbes, immunity and host-genetics.
hG957jTdf0g $$$ Fifty years later, many fundamental questions remain unanswered.
hG957jTdf0g $$$ Why BL occurs in a small fraction of people chronically exposed to malaria and/or EBV, the risk conveyed by infections singly or jointly, the specific malaria or EBV proteins involved, and whether EBV or malaria have high-risk variants for BL and the pathogen-host interactions involved in BL.
hG957jTdf0g $$$ In addition, we do not know how to prevent or adequately treat BL.
hG957jTdf0g $$$ The lecture will dissect the epidemiology of BL, particularly in Africa.
hG957jTdf0g $$$ It will explore the inherent difficulties quantifying the association of malaria, EBV, and other exposures in human populations in an effort to summarize the strength and weaknesses of the evidence linking EBV and malaria to BL.
hG957jTdf0g $$$ Borrowing from malaria diagnostic and vaccine studies, the lecture will explore new approaches to quantify risks of association with specific pathogen proteins and insights into pathways potentially exploited to increase or decrease the risk of BL.
hG957jTdf0g $$$ It will also highlight the potential of proteomics and genomics technologies to slingshot discoveries in BL.
hG957jTdf0g $$$ Finally, the lecture will offer a panoramic view of BL as a complex model for carcinogenesis and highlight the critical nature of multidisciplinary and international collaboration to engage and build capacity for pediatric oncology research in developing countries where BL is endemic.

hb8HgUZ-Ugw $$$ Here are just a few of the ways that the World Health Organization is responding to #COVID19.Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.
hb8HgUZ-Ugw $$$ Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads.
hb8HgUZ-Ugw $$$ Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.
hb8HgUZ-Ugw $$$ The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so its important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).Learn more:

nngDYx9EQO0 $$$ Im an economist in CDCs Center for Global Health.My general interest in economics started when I was a child and wanted to fight poverty.
nngDYx9EQO0 $$$  I got interested in health when I was getting my PhD from Rand and got involved in studies that use preventive care to improve the health of the population.At CDC, I analyze data to see if a policy or intervention related to vaccination in poor countries is cost-effective.
nngDYx9EQO0 $$$ Vaccines prevent diseases and save costs.
nngDYx9EQO0 $$$ My job is to estimate the costs and the benefits.The results of these evaluations contribute to extending the use of vaccines where they are needed and effective, and help us to control and prevent diseases.
nngDYx9EQO0 $$$ I do most of my work at my desk.
nngDYx9EQO0 $$$ However, sometimes I go into the field to collect data, train in-country teams about health economics, and help countries use economic information in their public health decisions.For example, I evaluated the cost of an intervention referring children for birth registration and vaccinations in rural Zambia, and I estimated the cost of typhoid fever in countries with high disease rates such as Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan to inform decisions about the value of introducing typhoid vaccines in specific contexts.My work at CDC is exciting.
nngDYx9EQO0 $$$ It allows me to apply my economic knowledge to help stop the spread of diseases through vaccination and improve the health of people around the world.I am Nelly Mejia and I am CDCComments on this video are allowed in accordance with our comment policy: This video can also be viewed at

QEuGXJVJ8GI $$$ The COVID-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on the rights and health of older persons in our societies.
QEuGXJVJ8GI $$$ While the infection spreads among persons of all ages, older persons and those with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death from COVID-19.
QEuGXJVJ8GI $$$ Symptomatic individuals in their seventies are twenty times more likely to require hospitalization than young adults, and case fatality rates suggest a notable increase in risk after age 60, with progressively worse outcomes at older ages.
QEuGXJVJ8GI $$$ Less visible but no less worrisome are the broader effects: health care denied for conditions unrelated to COVID-19; neglect and abuse in institutions and care facilities; an increase in poverty and unemployment; the dramatic impact on well-being and mental health; and the trauma of stigma and discrimination.
QEuGXJVJ8GI $$$ As the pandemic spreads across low, middle and high income countries, the needs of older persons may also differ, and severe disease and mortality rates for older persons may increase even further if fragile health and social protection systems are overwhelmed

QX1WwBw5rQ8 $$$ In 2019, International Medical Corps and National Geographic teamed up to bring Photo Camp to a group of young Somali refugees from Melkadida Refugee Camp in Ethiopia.
QX1WwBw5rQ8 $$$ \"Picture: Hope\" documents the week-long experience, capturing the joy of self-expression and highlighting the impact of supporting positive mental health.The years between childhood and adulthood are critical to learning, discovering and developing a sense of ones self in the world.
QX1WwBw5rQ8 $$$ But in Melkadida refugee camp, located in a desert on the Ethiopia/Somalia border, young people have few options or opportunities.
QX1WwBw5rQ8 $$$ Many families have spent the better part of a decade at the camp, where there is nowhere to go and little to do.Some schooling is available to young refugees, but many children cannot attend because of responsibilities in the home or limited family resources.
QX1WwBw5rQ8 $$$ And children with physical, intellectual or mental health and behavioral challenges are often kept home, viewed as difficult to accommodate, or due to family fears about bullying and stigmatization.
QX1WwBw5rQ8 $$$ This separation from peers can cause a young person to become isolated, and can create or exacerbate mental health issues at a foundational time in life.
QX1WwBw5rQ8 $$$ Interventions that promote positive mental health can have a profound positive impact on long-term individual and community outcomes.
QX1WwBw5rQ8 $$$ International Medical Corps has been at the camp since 2011 providing mental health and psychosocial support services.

How many coronavirus vaccines are there in development, and how far along are some of them? So there appears to be four different types of vaccines being developed.
2DUiBlj5rsQ $$$ Do companies bet on one type, or do they develop more than one type? How large are phase two trials in comparison to phase three trials? What committees do you sit on? Human challenge trials Does that approval of human challenge trials rest with the FDA? Are there any robust, larger phase two trials ongoing?
2DUiBlj5rsQ $$$ What is the timeline for those trials? What happens if there's little disease over the summer?
2DUiBlj5rsQ $$$ How does that impact these trials? When do you begin to accrue meaningful data from that these studies?
2DUiBlj5rsQ $$$  Will there be a distribution of ages in terms of people who are vaccinated for these studies? So over the summer, we begin to accrue more information, but how valuable that information is will depend upon how much disease is in the area where people have been vaccinated.
2DUiBlj5rsQ $$$ Is that an accurate statement?
2DUiBlj5rsQ $$$  Do they just add more and more numbers to the initial phase three trial if there's simply not enough disease? Will a vaccine be 100% effective? What is Operation Warp Speed? Mass producing the vaccine while coronavirus trials are ongoing. Does America's investment in a vaccine then entitle the US to \"own\" that vaccine or some portion of that vaccine?
2DUiBlj5rsQ $$$  Do you have any sense of how the issue of equity will play out in the US and other countries? With Operation Warp Speed, do you anticipate that a successful phase three trial will lead to 300 million doses a few months later? Vaccine-hesitancy Political pressure on the FDA to approve a vaccine What will be the mechanism that will lead to FDA approval of a vaccine? Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are examples of why we need randomized clinical trials for COVID-19 treatments. Why are we optimistic about a vaccine that's 1) a first-of-a-kind mRNA vaccine and 2) a first-of-a-kind coronavirus vaccine?
2DUiBlj5rsQ $$$  Which vaccine will be made under Operation Warp Speed? For the phase three trials to start in July, are there plans to recruit enhanced numbers of Latinx and African Americans - who are known to have higher infectious rates for whatever reason?

2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ Highlights: Host(H): Welcome to Cancer Newsline a podcast series from University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center.
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ Today we'll be talking about one of our Moon Shot Programs 
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ Our two guests today are Dr. Jim Allison Chairman of Immunology here at MD Anderson and Dr. Pam Sharma who is an Associate Professor in GU Medical Oncology and also the Scientific Director of Immunotherapy Platform.
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ Dr. Allison's work that he brought to MD Anderson is really helping us make great strides in immunotherapy in this instance for melanoma 
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ H: Dr. Sharma, as the Director of the Immunotherapy Platform, obviously you're building the basis for trials and studies and then the translational research into the clinic, tell us more about your flexible clinical trial design.
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ How important was that in dovetailing with Dr. Allison's work?Dr.
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ Sharma: So I think we all wanted to understand what were the immune responses and the patients.
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ So if you took the brakes off, if you block CTLA4 and you enhance T-cell responses, what did that look like?
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ What does that mean?
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ How are the T-cells now changed so that they can start to attack the cancer cells?
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ Because the basic thinking is that the immune system exists within all of us.
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ We all have the same immune system.
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ The immune system can protect us from viral or bacterial antigens, also from cancer antigens as Jim was mentioning.
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ So why does the cancer then grow if we have this immune system and this immune response there?
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ So really we could understand that the immune system was becoming not capable of functioning in the same way because the tumors learn how to evade the immune response.
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ Also the immune system was not really having the effect that we needed it to have because it had all of these brakes, these inhibitory signals like CTLA4 and PD1 affecting it.
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ So if you gave an antibody to block, then you could take off those signals, but once you remove the inhibitory signals, what did the T-cells really do?
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ Why was it that only some patients could respond to the therapy and not others?
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ If we learned something from the ones who are responding, could we then apply it to the patients who are not responding initially and then get them to respond to the therapy as well?
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ That way you can have more and more patients.
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ So then you're trying to understand what's going on and it's hard to get tumor tissues in that setting because they have metastatic disease and it's not easy to give biopsies and it's not easy to grow enough T-cells out of the small biopsies.
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ So we designed a clinical trial where patients with localized disease, these are patients with early stage disease who are scheduled for surgery.
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ So these patients participate in what we term the pre-surgical clinical trials in that they got some of the drug, they went to surgery and we were able to now take all of their tumor tissues at the time of surgery to ask what are the T-cells doing in these tumors?
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ How are they different from patients who didn't get the drug?
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ So it's important because we had another cohort of patients who went directly to surgery as they normally would without participating on the protocol and that was the comparison group to see how did the untreated versus treated look in terms of a immune response that's occurring within the tumor and by that way we can start to identify potential mechanisms or markers and in this setting we identified a marker known as i-clos, where we were able to say this is probably an important player in why these immune responses are occurring and then Jim and I collaborated to actually show that was true in mouse models and now hopefully we can start to think of how to bring target of i-clos back to the clinic for patients again.
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ So it was a 12-patient clinical trial that first pre-surgical trial in bladder cancer patients and from 12 patients we could learn a lot because we had the tumor tissues and the blood and so it really provided us with mechanistic details that I don't think that in 800-patient trials where all you're getting is blood gives you the same kind of understanding.
2kEc2aa63NQ $$$ So we're big proponents with immunotherapy platform of trying to not only think of your Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials, which we're all used to, but also thinking of these small mechanism based trials, these 10-20 patient trials to really understand how do these drugs work either as monotherapy or in combination with other things.Download podcast:

a7Oe4bOMBws $$$ Here are just a few of the ways that the World Health Organization is responding to #COVID19.Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.
a7Oe4bOMBws $$$ Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads.
a7Oe4bOMBws $$$ Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.
a7Oe4bOMBws $$$ The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so its important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).Learn more:

QlSw1ARMX0Q $$$ The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released guidelines to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection at youth summer camp.
QlSw1ARMX0Q $$$ But what do those guidelines mean for families and children who look forward to the ritual of attending overnight or day summer camp?\"There not one strategy that's going to completely eliminate risk.
QlSw1ARMX0Q $$$ But using multiple strategies can reduce the risk for everyone who's attending,\" says Dr. Nipunie Rajapakse, a pediatric infectious diseases physician.Some of the strategies include trying to limit the size of the camp as much as possible so that it's a smaller group of children maybe with one camp counselor or supervisor rather than having large groups of children mixing.
QlSw1ARMX0Q $$$ \"Testing prior to attending camp one to three days before camp starts is another strategy that can help reduce the risk of someone coming to the camp who's infected and going on to transmit to others,\" says Dr. Rajapakse.
QlSw1ARMX0Q $$$ \"And, certainly, if anyone is feeling ill or having symptoms in any way, they should not be attending.\"For the safety of its patients, staff and visitors, Mayo Clinic has strict masking policies in place.
