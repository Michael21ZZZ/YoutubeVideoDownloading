what is diabetic cardiomyopathy .
what does diabetic cardiomyopathy .
diabetic cardiomyopathy meaning diabetic cardiomyopathy .
source wikipedia org article adapted under diabetic cardiomyopathy is disorder of the heart muscle in people with diabetes .
it can lead to inability of the heart to circulate blood through the body effectively state known as heart failure with accumulation of fluid in the lungs pulmonary edema or legs .
most heart failure in people with diabetes results from coronary artery disease and diabetic cardiomyopathy is only said to exist if there is no coronary artery disease to explain the heart muscle disorder .
one particularity of dcm is the long latent phase during which the disease .
in most cases dcm is detected with concomitant hypertension or coronary artery disease .
one of the earliest signs is mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction with little effect on ventricular .
also the diabetic patient may show subtle signs of dcm related to decreased left ventricular compliance or left ventricular hypertrophy .
prominent wave can also be noted in the jugular venous pulse and the cardiac .
after the development of systolic dysfunction left ventricular dilation and symptomatic heart failure .
systolic mitral murmur is not uncommon in these cases .
these changes are accompanied by variety of electroc ardiographic changes that may be associated with dcm in of patients without structural heart disease .
later in the progression prolonged qt interval may be indicative of fibrosis .
given that dcm definition excludes concomitant atherosclerosis or hypertension there are no changes in perfusion or in atrial natriuretic peptide levels up until the very late stages of the disease when the hypertrophy and fibrosis .
defects in cellular processes such as autophagy and mitophagy are thought to contribute to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy .
diabetic cardiomyopathy is characterized functionally by ventricular dilation enlargement of heart cells prominent interstitial fibrosis and decreased or preserved .
while it has been evident for long time that the complications seen in diabetes are related to the hyperglycemia associated to it several factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease .
etiologically four main causes are responsible for the development of heart failure in dcm microangiopathy and related endothelial dysfunction autonomic neuropathy metabolic alterations that include abnormal glucose use and increased fatty acid oxidation generation and accumulation of free radicals .
microangiopathy can be characterized as subendothelial and endothelial fibrosis in the coronary microvasculature of the heart .
this endothelial dysfunction leads to impaired myocardial blood .
about of diabetics with dcm show pathologic evidence for microangiopathy such as sub endothelial and endothelial fibrosis compared to only of non diabetic heart failure .
over the years several hypotheses were postulated to explain the endothelial dysfunction observed in diabetes .
it was hypothesized that the extracellular hyperglycemia leads to an intracellular hyperglycemia in cells unable to regulate their glucose uptake most predominantly endothelial cells .
indeed while hepatocytes and myocytes have mechanisms allowing them to internalize their glucose transporter endothelial cells do not possess .
the consequences of increased intracellular glucose concentration are fourfold all resulting from increasing concentration of glycolytic intermediates upstream of the rate limiting glyceraldehyde phosphate reaction which is inhibited by mechanisms activated by increased free radical formation common in diabetes .
four pathways enumerated below all explain part of the diabetic complications .

it was first known in the th century .
again diabetes is differentiated in to two types diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus .
diabetes mellitus is mainly caused by deficiency of insulin due to either lack of energy in pancreas or any auto immune disease .
while diabetes insipidus is caused by defect in secretion of vasopressin antidiuretic hormone which is secreted from pituitary gland present in hypothalamus .
its function is to reabsorb water from distal tubules in the kidney .
but its deficiency caused increased water excretion through urine even in low intake of water .
diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus are unrelated although they have similar signs and symptoms like excessive thirst and excessive urination .
diabetes mellitus is more common than the diabetes insipidus .

so there is an increase in high blood sugar .
most gestational diabetes goes away after child birth .
common symptoms of gestation diabetes increased urination fatigue or tiredness increased thirst nausea and vomiting blurred vision weight loss hormonal imbalance head aches body pain diabetes insipidus the several forms of diabetes insipidus are neurogenic diabetes insipidus neurogenic diabetes insipidus is more commonly known as central diabetes insipidus .
it is caused by the damage of pituitary gland present in hypothalamus region or other reasons like autoimmune infection surgery head trauma and some drugs .
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by an improper response of the kidney to adh leading to decrease in the ability of kidney to concentrate the urine by removing free water .
dipsogenic diabetes insipidus dipsogenic diabetes insipidus is defect or damage to the thirst mechanism which is located in the hypothalamus .
this defect results in the inability for water deficit to trigger vasopressin secretion and thirst .
such patients tend to develop hypernatermia and dehydration .

when high levels of glucose enter the blood stream insulin is released by beta cells in the pancreas .
insulin then initiates number of signal pathways in specific muscle and fat cells .
this takes look at the signal pathway responsible for allowing those cells to rapidly increase their ability to uptake glucose from the blood stream .
lumbar disc bulge treatment in nadipathy our spinal cord comprises of many bones known as vertebrae each of which is separated by disc .
the disc is wrapped by the many layers .
in the middle of the disc .
when this jelly like substance leaked from the disc due to tear in connective tissue it is called lumbar .
lumbar disc bulge most commonly occur in people who have heavy work on sitting and bending .
the lowest disc of the spine is most commonly affected with the disc .
symptoms pain after standing and sitting headache especially in back of the head numbness or abnormal sensation in whole body when you bend the spinal cord forward feel pain over the buttocks thigh lower leg or foot pain get worse during nights reasons to develop lumbar disc bulge being over weight having the job with more bending .

this presentation will describe contaminant exposures and fish consumption .
one of the first prospective investigations on the role of pop exposures in the development of diabetes was conducted in this cohort finding elevated diabetes risk in persons with greater exposure to dde .
while the biologic pathways by which environmental exposures may increase diabetes risk have not been elucidated evidence will be presented that suggest pops may have stronger impact on blood glucose in persons at higher risk for diabetes .
click here type diabetesis chronic disease characterized by abnormal glucose metabolism .
type diabetes is by far the most common form of diabetics actually suffer .
in the case of type diabetes there is resistance of the tissues to insulin and decreased response to glucose by the pancreas .
the circulating endogenous insulin is sufficient to prevent ketosis .
there is often excessive insulin secretion and excessive activity of the beta cells in the pancreas .
diabetes is very widespread metabolic disorder .
studies have estimated that in there were million people infected with the disease worldwide and according to several estimations the number will reach million by this is chronic condition that may remain silent for long periods and the progression of the disease .
the most important step you can take to treat diabetes naturally without drugs lose weight obesity .
abdominal obesity is even more dangerous and is an important and independent risk factor for the occurrence of hyperlipidemia hypertension cardiovascular disease and diabetes especially type this happens because visceral fat is not an inert tissue but is actually an endocrine organ that produces many hormones that regulate the energy homeostasis of the body and affects the secretion of insulin that can cause inflammation in the blood vessels .
visceral fat may cause weight gain high levels of fasting glucose and insulin resistance .
safe indicator of abdominal obesity is the measurement of waist .
waist circumference should be under cm for men and under cm for women .
in conclusion increased levels of visceral fat is major risk factor for developing type diabetes and should be addressed by any diabetic patient that wishes to treat the disease .
what is more it has been shown that loss of of your total body weight can represents loss of visceral fat by about which improves the function .
make sure you lose weight gradually and try to adopt healthy eating .
what you need to do measure your waistline .
as mentioned above the limit is cm for women and cm for men .
the larger the circumference of your waist the greater risk to become diabetic .
if you already suffer with this condition then large waist circumference may compromise glycemic control since it reduces the body ability to handle glucose while increasing insulin .
regularly check the levels of lipids and glucose in the blood .
now pay close attention here to control type diabetes there is an amazing method that can help you reverse the disease .
metabolic syndrome is probably the most serious medical condition that you haven heard .
so what is metabolic syndrome why is it so serious and why haven you heard .
here is what you need to know .
the metabolic syndrome is cluster of the most dangerous heart attack risk factors raised blood glucose central adiposity often called beer belly abnormal cholesterol levels abnormal blood fats also called triglycerides and high blood pressure .
it is estimated that in adults have metabolic syndrome and the condition becomes more common as we get older so that by the age of nearly third of adults have metabolic syndrome .
so why is metabolic syndrome .
well if you have metabolic syndrome you are much more likely to suffer heart attack or stroke more likely to develop full blown diabetes more likely to develop cancer and more likely to develop alzheimer disease .
all of these conditions .
dementia and alzheimer disease have overtaken cancer and heart disease as the leading cause of death in england and wales in and the metabolic syndrome and diabetes .
so how can you check to see if you have metabolic syndrome .
well first of all get out tape measure .
if you are man and your waist circumference is more than cm or if you are woman and your waist is more than cm you have one of the main features of metabolic syndrome .
if in addition you have any of the following you will be classified as having metabolic syndrome raised blood triglycerides reduced hdl cholesterol sometimes known as good cholesterol raised blood pressure or raised fasting plasma glucose .
note if you are man of south asian or indian heritage the important threshold for waist circumference is cm .
metabolic syndrome has not yet been classified as disease it is still regarded as collection of signs and symptoms which together are serious risk factors for our most deadly and disabling medical conditions .
several medical organisations such as the world health organisation who the independent diabetes federation idf and the european group for the study of insulin resistance egir define the metabolic syndrome in very slightly different ways and this adds even more to the confusion about what exactly metabolic syndrome .
however many experts now believe that the underlying problem in metabolic syndrome is insulin resistance .
insulin resistance develops when this hormone cannot work properly when blood insulin levels are abnormally high and still relatively ineffective in keeping blood glucose levels .
metabolic specialists now use the term insulin resistance syndrome .
insulin is hormone produced by the pancreas and it is important in the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats .
when sugar and carbohydrates are eaten insulin promotes the uptake of glucose from the blood into muscles and fat cells .
hence it is often said that insulin allows cells to use glucose for energy and also to store excess glucose and sugar as glycogen and fat .
when blood glucose levels fall stored glucose is released for energy from the breakdown of glycogen stores in the liver and in the muscles .
in the metabolic syndrome .
fasting blood levels of insulin in the morning are often abnormally high and insulin levels rise to very high levels when food is eaten .
continuously high levels of insulin cause the liver cells to store fat resulting in fatty liver which cannot function .
as the insulin resistance worsens the pancreas may not be able to produce enough insulin in response to food and then glucose levels in the blood .
so why haven you heard .
well until quite recently the connection between metabolic syndrome and host of chronic diseases .
we now know that insulin resistance .
until recently it was difficult to measure blood insulinlevels but the technology has improved and we can now measure blood insulin levels accurately and we have good tests to diagnose insulin resistance as well as good strategies to reverse insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome .
once you can measure insulin resistance you are well on your way to fixing .

leptin and the neural circuit regulation food intake and glucose metabolism air date wednesday january pm category wals wednesday afternoon lectures runtime description nih director wednesday afternoon lecture series the discovery of leptin has led to the elucidation of robust physiologic system that maintains fat stores at relatively constant level .
leptin is peptide hormone secreted by adipose tissue in proportion to its mass .
this hormone circulates in blood and acts on the hypothalamus to regulate food intake and energy expenditure .
when fat mass falls plasma leptin levels fall stimulating appetite and suppressing energy expenditure .
when fat mass increases leptin .
by such mechanism total energy stores are stably maintained within relatively narrow range .
recessive mutations in the leptin gene are associated with massive obesity .
treatment with recombinant leptin markedly reduces food intake .
the low leptin levels in patients with leptin mutations are also associated with multiple abnormalities including infertility diabetes and immune abnormalities all of which are corrected by leptin treatment .
these findings have established important links between energy stores and many other physiologic systems and led to the use of leptin as treatment for an increasing number of other human conditions including subset of obesity some forms of diabetes including lipodystrophy and hypothalamic amenorrhea the cessation of menstruation .
identification of physiologic system that controls energy balance establishes biologic basis for obesity .
recent studies have explored the relationship between leptin .
in addition new methods for identifying neurons activated by leptin and other stimuli have been developed as have methods for noninvasively activating cells .
these new approaches are being applied to studies .

if in the us use this link an introductory lesson into the nature of tissue fluid formation and lymphatic drainage .
includes brief introduction into the functions of lymphatic drainage in health and disease the lymphatic system the lymphatic system consists of the lymphatic drainage vessels .
lymphatic tissue is also sometimes referred to as lymphoid tissue .
lymphatic drainage structures lymphatic capillaries drain .
most of the tissue fluid formed at the arterial end of the capillary is as we have seen reabsorbed back into the blood at the venous end .
however along with tissue fluid few protein molecules also escape from the capillaries .
if these large osmotic molecules were allowed to remain in the tissue fluid they would increase the osmotic potential leading to an accumulation of water .
an excess of fluid in the tissues is abnormal and is termed oedema .
if excess tissue fluid was allowed to accumulate this would cause swelling and would increase the diffusional distance between the blood and tissue cells .
this would reduce the speed at which oxygen could be delivered to tissue cells .
the mechanism which removes exuded proteins from the tissue fluid preventing oedema is the lymphatic drainage .
once fluid has passed from the tissue spaces into lymphatic vessel .
unlike blood capillaries the lymphatic capillaries .
however like blood capillaries .
lymphatic capillaries are highly permeable and will absorb excess tissue fluid and infecting bacteria as well as proteins .
endothelial cells which compose the lymphatic capillary walls .
the cells also overlap to form valves .
this means fluid and other material is able to enter from the tissue spaces but may not escape back out from the lymphatic capillaries .
as lymphatic capillary fills with lymph the pressure in the lumen will close the valves .
its strange the lymphatic system .

nadi diagnose nadi can be measured in the superficial middle and deep levels thus obtaining more information regarding energy imbalance .
when the body becomes weak .
if any one of the nadi not working properly it multiplies gradually .
decreases its energy that reflects gradually in the subtle body and it change as disease on the physical body .
modern doctors can recognize diseases .
our body is making up with nadi all the nadi are inter linked to every organ .
if there is any blockage to such nadi it does not work properly .
so those organs get lack of energy to function .
before to the treatment nadipathy treats on the root .
treatment method by using acupuncture acupressure marma therapy vedic therapy magnet therapy seed therapy massage therapy cupping therapy detoxifation therapy naturopathy beach sand therapy and some other natural therapies to remove the waste materials excess heat present inside the body .

diabetes treatment in nadipathy what is diabetes it is the condition that body cannot balance the glucose levels due to lack of energy to pancreas or the body cannot utilize insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis .
it was first known in the th century .
again diabetes is differentiated in to two types diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus .
diabetes mellitus is mainly caused by deficiency of insulin due to either lack of energy in pancreas or any auto immune disease .
while diabetes insipidus is caused by defect in secretion of vasopressin antidiuretic hormone which is secreted from pituitary gland present in hypothalamus .
its function is to reabsorb water from distal tubules in the kidney .
but its deficiency caused increased water excretion through urine even in low intake of water .
diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus are unrelated although they have similar signs and symptoms like excessive thirst and excessive urination .
diabetes mellitus is more common than the diabetes insipidus .

metabolic syndrome is probably the most serious medical condition that you haven heard .
so what is metabolic syndrome why is it so serious and why haven you heard .
here is what you need to know .
the metabolic syndrome is cluster of the most dangerous heart attack risk factors raised blood glucose central adiposity often called beer belly abnormal cholesterol levels abnormal blood fats also called triglycerides and high blood pressure .
it is estimated that in adults have metabolic syndrome and the condition becomes more common as we get older so that by the age of nearly third of adults have metabolic syndrome .
so why is metabolic syndrome .
well if you have metabolic syndrome you are much more likely to suffer heart attack or stroke more likely to develop full blown diabetes more likely to develop cancer and more likely to develop alzheimer disease .
all of these conditions .
dementia and alzheimer disease have overtaken cancer and heart disease as the leading cause of death in england and wales in and the metabolic syndrome and diabetes .
so how can you check to see if you have metabolic syndrome .
well first of all get out tape measure .
if you are man and your waist circumference is more than cm or if you are woman and your waist is more than cm you have one of the main features of metabolic syndrome .
if in addition you have any of the following you will be classified as having metabolic syndrome raised blood triglycerides reduced hdl cholesterol sometimes known as good cholesterol raised blood pressure or raised fasting plasma glucose .
note if you are man of south asian or indian heritage the important threshold for waist circumference is cm .
metabolic syndrome has not yet been classified as disease it is still regarded as collection of signs and symptoms which together are serious risk factors for our most deadly and disabling medical conditions .
several medical organisations such as the world health organisation who the independent diabetes federation idf and the european group for the study of insulin resistance egir define the metabolic syndrome in very slightly different ways and this adds even more to the confusion about what exactly metabolic syndrome .
however many experts now believe that the underlying problem in metabolic syndrome is insulin resistance .
insulin resistance develops when this hormone cannot work properly when blood insulin levels are abnormally high and still relatively ineffective in keeping blood glucose levels .
metabolic specialists now use the term insulin resistance syndrome .
insulin is hormone produced by the pancreas and it is important in the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats .
when sugar and carbohydrates are eaten insulin promotes the uptake of glucose from the blood into muscles and fat cells .
hence it is often said that insulin allows cells to use glucose for energy and also to store excess glucose and sugar as glycogen and fat .
when blood glucose levels fall stored glucose is released for energy from the breakdown of glycogen stores in the liver and in the muscles .
in the metabolic syndrome .
fasting blood levels of insulin in the morning are often abnormally high and insulin levels rise to very high levels when food is eaten .
continuously high levels of insulin cause the liver cells to store fat resulting in fatty liver which cannot function .
as the insulin resistance worsens the pancreas may not be able to produce enough insulin in response to food and then glucose levels in the blood .
so why haven you heard .
well until quite recently the connection between metabolic syndrome and host of chronic diseases .
we now know that insulin resistance .
until recently it was difficult to measure blood insulin levels but the technology has improved and we can now measure blood insulin levels accurately and we have good tests to diagnose insulin resistance as well as good strategies to reverse insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome .
once you can measure insulin resistance you are well on your way to fixing .
there is strong connection between type diabetes and dyslipidemia .
this animation describes the lipid abnormalities commonly seen in patients with type diabetes elevated levels of triglycerides raised small dense ldl levels increased glycation and oxidation of ldls .
these factors increase the risk of cardiovascular disease .

diabetes and migraines an unlikely combination in the there was suggested link between diabetes and migraines .
it was simple people who had diabetes were less likely to complain about migraines diabetes is lifelong condition that can cause person blood glucose sugar level to become dangerously high it affects approx million people in the uk there are two types type is where your own bodies immune system cells attack and destroy the cells that produce insulin the hormone that reduces your blood sugar levels type is where your body either doesn produce enough insulin or your cells don respond to insulin in both circumstances it means your blood glucose levels are not reduced and this is life threatening migraine is recurring headache that feels like severe throbbing pain on one side of the head symptoms can also include nausea vomiting and an increase in sensitivity to light or sound .
it affects out of women and out of men .
this is based on work done by ippazio antonazzo at the university of bergen in norway .
they looked at the drug prescription records of the under adult population of norway over year period there were million people in the study .
of these were being treated for type diabetes and for type diabetes they then looked at what proportion of these went on to get migraine medication compared to non diabetics their finding people with diabetes were less likely to be treated for migraine what they did not know if it was the disease or the medication that meant they were less likely to develop migraines it is thought that the nerve damage caused by diabetes makes it much more difficult to sense migraine .
one of the side effects of diabetes is nerve damage reducing sensation in the hands and feet this may also occur in the head .
or it could be that the link is genetic .
in some people who experience migraines they have mutation in gene that codes for protein which is sensitive to the hormone insulin .
insulin is the hormone produced when your blood glucose level increases and this is what is missing in type one diabetes and not detected by some cells in type diabetes so if people who have this mutation and develop migraines .
diabetics then treating diabetes would also normalise the insulin levels and decrease the occurrence of migraines .

how to boost insulin .
the answer is simple current diabetes theory is false and so are its treatments .
as the proof of the pudding is in the eating .
unfortunately the medical pudding .
listen why .
medicine diabetes type results from the autoimmune destruction of insulin producing beta cells in the pancreas .
autoimmune diseases arise from an abnormal immune response of the body against substances and tissues normally present in the body autoimmunity .
in other words our immune system which protects us against microbes and viruses may destroy insulin producing beta cells .
did it occur to you that autoimmunity is strictly human disease .
no living entity with an immune system .
the autoimmunity .
this false theory recommends also wrong treatment .
two theories viral theory virus cell destruction lysis necrosis transforms self to foreign antigens .
antigens trigger inflammation and repair .
organism may regenerate cells auto immunity molecular mimicry confuses immune system .
self peptide becomes an auto antigen auto antigen triggers inflammation .
inflammation .
cells .
organism does not regenerate cells finally explain how to boost insulin .
if you know someone struggling with their mental health digestion is typically involved in the process .
this case study demonstrates the power and efficacy of functional medicine .
landmark discovery about how insulin docks on cells could help in the development of improved types of insulin .
associate professor mike lawrence from the walter and eliza hall institute in melbourne australia explains how the research team captured the intricate way in which insulin uses the insulin receptor .
this binding is necessary for the cells .
read the media release .
controlling and reversing diabetes solution for diabetes must address important health items the elimination of excess fat surrounding the pancreas the regeneration of healthy cells removing any unhealthy or abnormal cells restoring strong signaling and communication between cells phytotherapi diabetes solution includes tools that address these important items while also including specific nutritional guidelines so that the body .
these tools include phytotherapi diabetes .
phytotherapi diabetes is made from blend of phytochemicals that helps support the pancreas ability to perform .
phytotherapi diabetes also helps minimize the inflammation .
phytotherapi stress is used to help put our brain biochemistry back into balance .
by addressing stress good intestinal bacteria are strengthened so they can play their important role in the digestive process .
metabolic therapi supports the body ability to map out excess fat so that the body .
renewal therapi aids .
through strengthening signaling the body can eliminate abnormal cells repair sick .
renewal therapi contains perfect mix of molecules that enhance the communication passages between cells in tissues allowing quick response for regeneration .
essential therapi provides the full amount of essential minerals the body needs for cellular .
herbal therapi keeps cells healthy by supporting insulin production and helping lower blood sugar levels .
since what we eat has direct correlation to how the body functions and heals proper nutrition is vital in helping the body reverse diabetes .
due to how powerful food can be in improving health we ve created nutritional guide that helps create the environment necessary for the body to heal and repair .
this nutritional guide .
through following the program many individuals have seen improvements in their health energy levels and an overall renewed sense of life as they ve seen and felt the health of their body .
diabetes insulin and the pancreas diabetes is disease that isn manifested until conditions .
diabetes impedes the body .
it important to remember that most of the nutrients we eat are converted into sugar .
the sugar .
the pancreas is an organ that makes insulin to help transport glucose sugar .
when too much sugar is present the pancreas continues to produce insulin and the liver does its job of converting excess sugar into fat .
this fat is then stored against organs including the pancreas .
these conditions lead .
first overproduction of insulin causes an overload of work which leads to the body inability to produce more insulin or use the existing insulin .
second overabundance of fat around the pancreas leads to trauma and damage .
pancreatic cells become sick and are unable to create good insulin .
initially any healthy cells make up for sick ones by doubling efforts to create the amount of insulin .
this is why early detection of diabetes .
once diabetes .
sugar continues to build up leading to nerve damage .
additional complications include kidney failure lsos of sight lower extremity amputations and heart and digestive problems .

polycystic ovary syndrome pcos is group of symptoms rather than specific disease .
while the ovaries may develop cysts that is not necessary for the diagnosis of pcos .
many patients who have pcos are overweight or obese .
it is one of the most common hormonal and reproductive conditions .
the primary cause of pcos may be due to abnormal production of certain hormones in the brain .
this disruption leads to an increase in the production of male hormones such as testosterone and inhibition of ovulation .
the most common symptom of pcos .
other symptoms include acne cardiovascular disease excessive body hair particularly facial hair infertility insulin resistance or pre diabetes .
because women with pcos can exhibit variety of symptoms .
treatment is tailored according to the particular symptoms .
medical therapies are often used to regulate menstrual cycles reduce testosterone levels lower insulin levels improve insulin sensitivity and eliminate unwanted hair .
nutrition education will help reduce excess weight .
located at the gretchen and edward fish center for women health in the brigham and women health care center in excess weight hill the polycystic ovary syndrome program brings together experts in gynecology endocrinology dermatology nutrition and other specialties to deliver comprehensive individualized and coordinated care for women with pcos .

what is diabetes .
diabetes is disease in which the body ability to produce or respond to the hormone insulin is impaired resulting in abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates and elevated levels of glucose .
how to cure diabetes .

blog www monicayearwood com product line www hamsaapothecary com ayurvedic center www hamsacenter com description of ayurveda resistance pcos diabetes thyroid disease when we consume carbohydrates weather steamed potato or candy bar our blood sugar .
to bring blood sugar back to normal the pancreas pumps insulin .
when we continuously cause blood sugar to spike through our food choices the pancreas goes into overdrive shooting too much insulin .
now blood sugar drops too low and our adrenal fight or flight hormones are called in by the hypothalamus .
the adrenal glands recognize low blood sugar as threat and send hormones out to boost it but these hormones .
chronic low or high blood sugars are gateways to diabetes .
dysglycemia condition in which the body loses the ability to keep blood sugar .
many folks in our modern world are on the verge of full blown diabetes and often unbeknownst to them are suffering .
dysglycemia and its effects on adrenal function are at the threshold of many health conditions including diabetes weakened digestion inflammation in the gut adrenal exhaustion hormonal imbalances weight gain and inability to properly detoxify the body .

diabetes mellitus is also simply known as diabetes .
it is the disease characterized by malfunctioning metabolism and high blood sugar level .
the result can be low levels of insulin or abnormal insulin resistance .

what is type diabetes .
type diabetes is condition in which your body has high blood sugar .
how does your blood sugar .
if you have insulin resistance your insulin cannot unlock the cells to let glucose in because the locks called the receptors .
as result glucose is locked out up of your cells .
consequently the amount of glucose builds up in the blood stream in condition called hyperglycaemia .
how do we lose the ability to create insulin .
to compensate for hyperglycaemia your pancreas produces more and more insulin .
your over worked beta cells try to keep up with the demand but gradually lose their capability to produce enough insulin .
if you don receive treatment for hyperglycaemia it can result in diabetic ketoacidosis as there will be shortage of insulin in the body .
over time chronic poorly controlled type diabetes can cause degenerative tissue damage resulting in long term complications such as atherosclerosis blindness neuropathy heart attack and renal failure .

one powerful antioxidant produced by the body is alpha lipoic acid .
alpha lipoic acid is found in every cell of the human .
both water soluble and fat soluble so able to act throughout the body .
antioxidants attack free radicals which are waste products that occur when the body creates energy through the food we eat .
free radicals can also come from exposure to toxins and pollutants .
negative effects of free radicals include slows metabolism abnormal cell growth and proliferation .
free radicals lead to cellular damage including damage to organs .

ala for fat loss and building muscle multiple studies have found ala .
one study followed obese diabetic patients for weeks with either mg supplementation of ala per day or placebo and found significant effect on body mass index and triglyceride levels decreasing bmi and triglyceride levels in the subjects with oral ala supplementation .
protection against insulin resistance .
insulin resistance leads to decreased glucose uptake in fat and muscle cells .
ala helps to turn glucose into energy or fuel for your body through insulin signaling when insulin binds to the insulin receptor cascade of events is started leading to increased cellular .
ala has been shown to activate this cascade of events leading to increased glucose uptake in fat and muscle cells .
this is done not through an effect on insulin levels but by triggering the same sequence of events leading to glucose transport for energy creation .
ala sort of mimics insulin .
studies have shown that this shuttling allows more glucose to enter skeletal muscle cells thus more glucose burned as for energy more energy to tear and rebuild muscles and less shuttled to be stored as fat .
when more glucose is delivered to muscle cells there is less available to be stored as fat .
so you have more fuel to push muscle growth and less glucose stored in fat cells muscle growth and less fat .
other possible uses of ala ala is approved in germany as treatment for diabetes and for symptoms of diabetes .
cancer memory loss chronic fatigue syndrome hiv aids heart disease eye related disorders how to add alpha lipoic acid to your diet foods high in ala broccoli spinach potatoes red meat organ .
you can also take supplements .
the bioavailability of supplemental ala has been shown to be much greater than that of dietary ala you can take about mg for antioxidant purposes up to mg per day for diabetic purposes as directed .

how hypokalemia causes tachycardia how it affects resting membrane potential .
electrolytes disorders .
this video and other related images videos in hd are available for instant download licensing here .
hypokalemia may result from increased excretion inadequate intake or shift of potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells .
most commonly hypokalemia is caused by excessive loss of potassium in the urine from the gi tract or skin .
the cause is usually apparent by the patient history of predisposing diseases or medication .
urine potassium levels are measured to differentiate between renal and non renal .
symptoms may include muscle weakness .
as potassium levels decrease in the extracellular space the magnitude of the potassium .
this moves .
the result is reduced excitability or responsiveness of the neurons and muscles .
in the heart .
this is because hyper polarization enhances the funny currents in cardiac pacemaker cells .
the effect is greatest in purkinje fibers as these are more sensitive to potassium levels as compared to the sa node .
increased automaticity of purkinje fibers may lead to the development of one or more ectopic pacemaker sites in the ventricles causing ventricular premature beats tachycardia and fibrillation .
reduced extracellular potassium also inhibits .
as hypokalemia becomes more severe especially in patients with other heart conditions .
prolonged repolarization may also promote re entrant arrhythmias .
early ecg changes .
these include flattening or inversion of wave increasingly prominent wave st segment depression and prolonged qu interval .
hypokalemia induced arrhythmias require immediate potassium replacement .
oral administration .
if potassium infusion is indicated continuous cardiac monitoring and hourly serum potassium determinations must be performed to avoid hyperkalemia complications .
many of the major illnesses that face us today have their origin in disturbances in our metabolism or at the very least they are made worse by metabolic problems .
illnesses such as obesity type diabetes high blood pressure non alcoholic fatty liver neuropathy some mental health problems some cancers the old theory of calories in calories out does not help us explain our current obesity .
the old advice to eat less and exercise more fails to provide healthy sustained weight loss .
and traditional advice on portion control weight management and eating starchy carbohydrates with every meal often does not help type diabetics many of whom see their illness as chronic and progressive with relentless deterioration towards more medication and eventually the prospect of insulin injections .

one of the primary influences in our cancer epidemic is insulin resistance diabetes .
right now there are about million diabetics in the however there are about million people with insulin resistance .
insulin resistance is the pre diabetic condition that has many of the destructive elements .
what this adds up to is that million people have developed one of the main foundations that cancer can build on .
when patient has been diagnosed with cancer and has insulin resistance type diabetes .
there are many reasons why .
it is also true that the ramifications of insulin resistance type diabetes are not handled with enough depth in both the diagnosis and treatment of cancer .

the miracle of xeronine xeronine the alkaloid of noni in the presence of insulin activate the peripheral cell membrane insulin receptors and helps for the normal intracellular absorption of glucose as well as corrects the intracellular post receptor defect of the action of insulin for carbohydrate metabolism and thus prevents the insulin resistance condition in diabetes .
noni the cell rejuvenator noni is believed to fortify and maintain the cell structure this can be accomplished by noni acting as an adaptogen that can aid sick .
xeronine and other nutraceuticals present in noni may convert the abnormal inactive insulin molecule present in type diabetes mellitus to an active form by modifying its cell rigidity and functional level to maintain its normal function of carbohydrate metabolismin our body .
noni works as healthy immune system promoter one of the nonis effects is on the pancreas and immune system .
current studies have revealed that noni may help promote healthy immune system or by either enhancing an already functioning system .
noni activating our body immune system may improve the non functioning beta cells of the pancreas to an active form to produce the normal insulin from the beta cells and also maintain normal insulin level in the blood to the response of the carbohydrate diet .
low glycemic index ratio of carbohydrates to fiber in noni juice helps balance blood glucose level .
glycemic index refers to method of classification by which number is assigned to foods based on how they affect blood sugar levels .
foods that contain the same amount of total carbohydrate .
for example kidney beans increase blood sugar levels more significantly than soya beans because of its higher glycemic .
noni has very low glycemic index and hence it reduces the risk of chronic conditions of diabetics noni might have the role by modifying our body immune system keeps the sensitivity of beta cells of the pancreas intact to produce an adequate amount of insulin in response to elevated blood glucose level by keeping and maintaining the balance of release of the neuro endocrine .
noni may help the diabetic complications like care of diabetic gangrene by its powerful healing effects and also helps diabetic poly neuropathy symptoms by providing number essential micronutrients vitamins essential minerals and amino acids .
noni may also help relieve diabetic complications through its ability to stimulate the bodys production of nitric oxide .
nitric oxide and scopoletin one ingredient in noni helps also reduce the diabetic hypertension .
both may also be important factors in decreasing symptoms .
hence it is the gods gift to the human society .

if you suffer episodes of hypoglycemia you may be at greater risk for diabetes .
it is good idea to avoid large carbohydrate .
both the types of carbs and the amount of carbs .
women with pcos have abnormal insulin regulation where there is often delay of insulin secretion with carbohydrate load then insulin secretion continues after hormone levels fall resulting in low sugars .
this is thought to be due to an abnormality in insulin secreting beta cells .
eventually if you lose enough of these cells you are at risk for diabetes .

regulation of insulin .
animated chinwe ntamere voice over rebecca yang script in normal person beta cells within the pancreas secrete what known as insulin into the bloodstream .
as insulin travels within the bloodstream it binds to the insulin receptors found on the cells .
as insulin and insulin receptor bind together it triggers whole series of events known as cell signaling cascade which brings up the glucose transporters .
and now glucose can enter the cells .
this brings down the blood glucose level .
however in type diabetic patient like jacob there problem .
while the beta cells secrete insulin and can bind to the insulin receptors the series of cell cascading event is altered so that the glucose transporters .
without the glucose transporters glucose cannot enter the cells and the blood glucose level remains high which is known as hyperglycemia .
ndsu virtual cell .
for more information please see .
when high levels of glucose enter the blood stream insulin is released by beta cells in the pancreas .
insulin then initiates number of signal pathways in specific muscle and fat cells .
this takes look at the signal pathway responsible for allowing those cells to rapidly increase their ability to uptake glucose from the blood stream .
diabetes mellitus is also simply known as diabetes .
it is the disease characterized by malfunctioning metabolism and high blood sugar level .
the result can be low levels of insulin or abnormal insulin resistance .

victoza liraglutide is glucagon like peptide glp receptor agonist indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type diabetes mellitus to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease .
liraglutide is an analog of human glp and acts as glp .
the peptide precursor of liraglutide produced by process that includes expression of recombinant dna in saccharomyces cerevisiae has been engineered to be homologous to native human glp by substituting arginine for lysine at position liraglutide is made by attaching fatty acid palmitic acid with glutamic acid spacer on the remaining lysine residue at position of the peptide .
liraglutide is an acylated human glp receptor agonist with amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human glp .
glp represents less than of total circulating endogenous glp like glp liraglutide activates the glp receptor membrane bound cell surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory protein .
liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic amp camp leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations .
this insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia .

individuals with extensive cell destruction and therefore no residual insulin secretion require insulin .
the severity of the metabolic abnormality can progress regress or stay the same .
thus the degree of hyperglycemia reflects the severity of the underlying metabolic process and its treatment more than the nature of the process .
the human body wants blood glucose .
insulin and glucagon are the hormones .
both insulin and glucagon are secreted from the pancreas and thus are referred to as pancreatic endocrine hormones .
it is the production of insulin and glucagon by the pancreas which ultimately determines if patient has diabetes hypoglycemia or some other sugar .
role of insulin in blood glucose control insulin and glucagon are hormones secreted by islet cells within the pancreas .
they are both secreted in response to blood sugar levels .
insulin is normally secreted by the beta cells of the pancreas .
the stimulus for insulin secretion is high blood glucose .
although there is always low level of insulin secreted by the pancreas .
similarly as blood glucose falls the amount of insulin secreted by the pancreatic islets .
insulin has an effect on number of cells including muscle red blood cells and fat cells .
in response to insulin these cells absorb glucose out of the blood having the net effect of lowering the high blood glucose levels .
glucagon is secreted by the alpha cells of the pancreatic islets in much the same manner as insulin .
if blood glucose is high then no glucagon .
when blood glucose goes low however more and more glucagon .
like insulin glucagon has an effect on many cells of the body but most notably the liver .
the role of glucagon in blood glucose control the effect of glucagon is to make the liver release the glucose it has stored in its cells into the bloodstream .
glucagon also induces the liver to make glucose out of building blocks obtained from other nutrients found in the body .
our bodies desire blood glucose .
below is termed hypoglycemia .
above can be normal if you have eaten .
that is the reason of determining fasting blood sugar .
even after you have eaten however your glucose should be below above is termed hyperglycemia .
if your blood sugar measurements above after drinking sugar water drink glucose tolerance test then you are diagnosed with diabetes .

peptide peptide byproduct of insulin production usually by the pancreas .
the level of peptide is gauge of how much insulin is being produced in the body .
peptide is made up of chemical compounds called amino acids .
when the pancreas produces insulin it releases peptide into the bloodstream in the same way that the production of heat from burning coal or wood releases smoke .
the amount of peptide in the blood can indicate the presence .
for example abnormally low amounts of peptide in the blood suggest the insulin production is too low or absent because of type diabetes also known as juvenile or insulin dependent diabetes .
abnormally high amounts of peptide warn of the possible presence of tumor called an insulinoma that secretes insulin .

diabetes mellitus or simply diabetes is group of metabolic diseases in which person has high blood sugar either because the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or because cells do not respond to the insulin .
this high blood sugar produces the classical symptoms of polyuria frequent urination polydipsia increased thirst and polyphagia increased hunger .
there are three main types of diabetes mellitus dm .
type dm results from the body failure to produce insulin and currently requires the person to inject insulin or wear an insulin pump .
this form was previously referred to as insulin dependent diabetes mellitus iddm or juvenile diabetes .
type dm results from insulin resistance condition in which cells fail to use insulin properly sometimes combined with an absolute insulin .
this form was previously referred to as non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus niddm or adult onset diabetes .
the third main form gestational diabetes occurs when pregnant women without previous diagnosis of diabetes develop high blood glucose level .
it may precede development of type dm .
other forms of diabetes mellitus include congenital diabetes which is due to genetic defects of insulin secretion cystic fibrosis related diabetes steroid diabetes induced by high doses of glucocorticoids and several forms of monogenic diabetes .
untreated diabetes can cause many complications .
acute complications include diabetic ketoacidosis and nonketotic hyperosmolar coma .
serious long term complications include cardiovascular disease chronic renal failure and diabetic retinopathy .
adequate treatment of diabetes is thus important as well as blood pressure control and lifestyle factors such as stopping .
all forms of diabetes have been treatable since insulin .
insulin and some oral medications can cause hypoglycemia .
both types and are chronic conditions .
pancreas transplants have been tried with limited success in type dm gastric bypass surgery has been successful in many with morbid obesity and type dm .
gestational diabetes usually resolves after delivery .
type diabetes is partly inherited and then triggered by certain infections with some evidence pointing at coxsackie virus .
genetic element in individual susceptibility to some of these triggers has been traced to particular hla genotypes the genetic self identifiers relied upon by the immune system .
however even in those who have inherited the susceptibility type dm .

provo utah researchers have found compounds in chocolate that could help prevent and treat .
beta cells inside the islet of langerhans in the pancreas are responsible for secreting insulin the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels .
in someone suffering from type diabetes the beta cells malfunction and produce insufficient levels of insulin .
researchers at brigham young university have discovered that compounds found naturally in cocoa called epicatechin monomers are able to increase the ability of beta cells to secrete insulin .
the team said the compound successfully helped mice on high fat diet to cope with elevated blood sugar levels as well as decrease the extent of their obesity .
what happens is it protecting the cells .
the epicatechin monomers are making the mitochondria in the beta cells stronger which produces more atp cell energy source which then results in more insulin .
the team are looking for ways to extract the compound out of cocoa in order to make treatment for current diabetes patients and advised people not to stock up on chocolate .

what causes insulin resistance it is well known that insulin resistance commonly coexists with obesity .
elevated levels of free fatty acids and triglycerides in the blood stream and tissues have been found to contribute to diminished insulin .
these are correlated with excess body fat .
primarily cause by dieting choice sedentary lifestyle and smoking have also been linked to the causes of insulin sensitivity .
signs of high blood sugar may be warning sign that the body is developing an insulin sensitivity .
additional signs include sleepiness after meals increased blood pressure as well as weight gain fat .
how to manage it there are three ways to manage insulin resistance .
the most important is in person diet .
diet to keep your insulin resistance from increasing always eat .
breakfast provides kickstart to your metabolism that plays crucial role in helping your body properly process insulin .
grabbing quick snack instead of balanced meal will make it hard to keep your blood sugar levels .
to reduce your body insulin resistance .
whole grain rye is rich in fiber and has been shown to naturally increase your body insulin .
this is directly linked to lower insulin resistance and helps to increase your body sensitivity to insulin .
try eating rye pasta with food rich in lycopene .
exercise start an appropriate exercise regime .
choose something that is customized for current fitness levels .
any exercise will vastly improve overall nutrition .
you may be able lose the fat that causes insulin resistance but it will always be there waiting for you to give it foothold to take your body back .
stay on track with your diet changes and increase in exercise .
supplements there are variety of supplements available to help with insulin resistance .
cinnamomum cassia potent extract harvested from indonesian cinnamon bark that has been shown to effectively assist in managing blood sugar it is pure does not undergo any irradiation whatsoever and is concentrated .
also rare plant alkaloid called berberine which has been used for centuries .
berberine works slightly differently by improving the signaling between insulin and its associated receptors while also increasing glucose uptake by skeletal muscle not fat .

click here type diabetes is chronic disease characterized by abnormal glucose metabolism .
type diabetes is by far the most common form of diabetics actually suffer from this form of the disease .
in the case of type diabetes there is resistance of the tissues to insulin and decreased response to glucose by the pancreas .
the circulating endogenous insulin is sufficient to prevent ketosis .
there is often excessive insulin secretion and excessive activity of the beta cells in the pancreas .
diabetes is very widespread metabolic disorder .
studies have estimated that in there were million people infected with the disease worldwide and according to several estimations the number will reach million by this is chronic condition that may remain silent for long periods and the progression of the disease is highly unpredictable .
the most important step you can take to treat diabetes naturally without drugs lose weight obesity is taking epidemic proportions in many countries .
abdominal obesity is even more dangerous and is an important and independent risk factor for the occurrence of hyperlipidemia hypertension cardiovascular disease and diabetes especially type this happens because visceral fat is not an inert tissue but is actually an endocrine organ that produces many hormones that regulate the energy homeostasis of the body and affects the secretion of insulin that can cause inflammation in the blood vessels .
visceral fat may cause weight gain high levels of fasting glucose and insulin resistance .
safe indicator of abdominal obesity is the measurement of waist circumference .
waist circumference should be under cm for men and under cm for women .
in conclusion increased levels of visceral fat is major risk factor for developing type diabetes and should be addressed by any diabetic patient that wishes to treat the disease .
what is more it has been shown that loss of of your total body weight can represents loss of visceral fat by about which improves the function of the adipose tissue .
make sure you lose weight gradually and try to adopt healthy eating habits to ensure lasting results .
what you need to do measure your waistline .
as mentioned above the limit is cm for women and cm for men .
the larger the circumference of your waist the greater risk to become diabetic .
if you already suffer with this condition then large waist circumference may compromise glycemic control since it reduces the body ability to handle glucose while increasing insulin resistance .
regularly check the levels of lipids and glucose in the blood .
now pay close attention here to control type diabetes there is an amazing method that can help you reverse the disease the natural way .
metabolic syndrome is probably the most serious medical condition that you haven heard about yet .
so what is metabolic syndrome why is it so serious and why haven you heard about it .
here is what you need to know .
the metabolic syndrome is cluster of the most dangerous heart attack risk factors raised blood glucose central adiposity often called beer belly abnormal cholesterol levels abnormal blood fats also called triglycerides and high blood pressure .
it is estimated that in adults have metabolic syndrome and the condition becomes more common as we get older so that by the age of nearly third of adults have metabolic syndrome .
so why is metabolic syndrome so important .
well if you have metabolic syndrome you are much more likely to suffer heart attack or stroke more likely to develop full blown diabetes more likely to develop cancer and more likely to develop alzheimer disease .
all of these conditions are serious and they are getting far more common .
dementia and alzheimer disease have overtaken cancer and heart disease as the leading cause of death in england and wales in and the metabolic syndrome and diabetes are thought to be important risk factors for these conditions .
so how can you check to see if you have metabolic syndrome .
well first of all get out tape measure .
if you are man and your waist circumference is more than cm or if you are woman and your waist is more than cm you have one of the main features of metabolic syndrome .
if in addition you have any of the following you will be classified as having metabolic syndrome raised blood triglycerides reduced hdl cholesterol sometimes known as good cholesterol raised blood pressure or raised fasting plasma glucose .
note if you are man of south asian or indian heritage the important threshold for waist circumference is cm .
metabolic syndrome has not yet been classified as disease it is still regarded as collection of signs and symptoms which together are serious risk factors for our most deadly and disabling medical conditions .
several medical organisations such as the world health organisation who the independent diabetes federation idf and the european group for the study of insulin resistance egir define the metabolic syndrome in very slightly different ways and this adds even more to the confusion about what exactly metabolic syndrome is .
however many experts now believe that the underlying problem in metabolic syndrome is insulin resistance .
insulin resistance develops when this hormone cannot work properly when blood insulin levels are abnormally high and still relatively ineffective in keeping blood glucose levels regulated properly .
metabolic specialists now use the term insulin resistance syndrome instead of metabolic syndrome .
insulin is hormone produced by the pancreas and it is important in the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats .
when sugar and carbohydrates are eaten insulin promotes the uptake of glucose from the blood into muscles and fat cells .
hence it is often said that insulin allows cells to use glucose for energy and also to store excess glucose and sugar as glycogen and fat .
when blood glucose levels fall stored glucose is released for energy from the breakdown of glycogen stores in the liver and in the muscles .
in the metabolic syndrome insulin levels are chronically high .
fasting blood levels of insulin in the morning are often abnormally high and insulin levels rise to very high levels when food is eaten .
continuously high levels of insulin cause the liver cells to store fat resulting in fatty liver which cannot function normally .
as the insulin resistance worsens the pancreas may not be able to produce enough insulin in response to food and then glucose levels in the blood rise above the threshold for the patient to be called diabetic .
so why haven you heard of metabolic syndrome .
well until quite recently the connection between metabolic syndrome and host of chronic diseases was not fully understood .
we now know that insulin resistance is the key .
until recently it was difficult to measure blood insulin levels but the technology has improved and we can now measure blood insulin levels accurately and we have good tests to diagnose insulin resistance as well as good strategies to reverse insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome .
once you can measure insulin resistance you are well on your way to fixing it and monitoring improvement with interventions .

what is diabetes .
insulin is hormone secreted in beta cells of the pancreas which helps to decrease the level of glucose in our blood .
chromium is important for normal function of insulin and broccoli enriched in chromium .
diabetes is classified into type type and type or gestational diabetes .
gestational diabetes type occurs only during pregnancy .
if pancreas does not produce insulin is called type diabetes .
similarly if pancreas producing very low amount of insulin is called type diabetes .
diabetes may cause cardiovascular disease .
type diabetes is also known as juvenile diabetes type diabetes is common disease in children .
men who are living with low testosterone level have diabetes risk .
in order to prevent diabetes insulin helps to decrease glucose level .
similarly insulin can also help to decrease hungry and increase dopamine neurotransmitter level .
diabetic retinopathy is an eye disease caused by diabetes mellitus .
sometimes diabetes retinopathy may leads to blindness .
in globally core people had diabetes .
recently researchers identified that the eating potassium rich foods like white beans potato banana etc helps to prevent diabetes patients from renal failure .
th november of every year is the world diabetes awareness day .
what are the symptoms of diabetes .
the both diabetes insipidus and mellitus have same symptoms but they are exactly different from each other .
important symptoms of diabetes are listed below .
polydipsia it means excessive thirst caused by our body in order to minimize glucose concentration in our blood .
not to be confused with psycogenic polydipsia primary polydipsia which is an excessive thirst caused by mental stress .
polyurea it means frequent urine output due to polydipsia .
frequent masturbation does not cause polyurea polyphagia it means frequent hungry .
how to diagnose diabetes .
there are several types of test helps to diagnose diabetes .
benedict solution test is the simple urine test which helps to diagnose diabetes for our self in home .
fast sugar test fst also helps to diagnose diabetes .
glucometer is an advanced device which helps to diagnose diabetes within few seconds .
how to treat diabetes .
sitagliptin januvia lantus generic name linsulin glargine and metformin brand name metafort are the name of the drugs helps to treat diabetes mellitus .
but these drugs must not be use without doctor advice .
insulin injection also helps to reduce blood sugar level and fasting helps to reduce our sugar .
broccoli is the best nutrition food for patients who living with diabetes mellitus .
consuming large amount of water helps to push out blood glucose via urine .

pimple called lipoma the removal .
in this video have explained briefly about three types of adipose tissues white adipose tissue brown adipose tissue and biege adipose tissue .
the brown adipose tissue is abundantly seen in neonates and the quantity of it decreases as neonate develops into infant child adolescent and adult .
brown adipose tissue has more mitochondria with high expression of an uncoupler protein called thermogenin .
thermogenin is also referred as uncouplin protein ucp .
thermogenin acts as uncoupler of electron transport chain and uncouple oxidation from phosphorylation in electron transport chain .
this way thermogenin in brown adipose tissue decreases the efficiency of electron transport chain thereby decreasing effective atp generation from substrate oxidation .
watch my video on electron transport chain in the link below .
this patient came with the complaint of swelling on thigh .
it was diagnosed as lipoma .

there are many different ways to classify fat saturated trans unsaturated brown white and essential fatty acids .
some are essential for life and some are lethal .
where fat accumulates is also important .
if white fat accumulates inside the abdominal cavity it predisposes to the metabolic syndrome and type two diabetes with all of its complications .
however if it accumulates in other places it actually extends life expectancy .
brown fat accumulates in the neck in humans .
contrary to white fat which stores fat and makes us overweight brown fat burns fat when the body is exposed to cold and is associated with lower body weight .
wouldn it be wonderful if we could convert white fat to brown fat so we tend to burn it and weight less .
maybe not .
so far drugs that do this have been lethal .
find it very interesting that we re always looking for ways to subvert the way nature operates rather than live healthy lifestyle .
it is also interesting that fat is highly active tissue metabolically .
in general we have fat phobia in this country that is off target .
fat is healthy food and what our body burns for fuel most of the time .

you have ball of fat under skin lipomas check these natural and effective ways to eliminate it .
lipoma is benign tumor under the skin composed of adipose tissue which is the most common form of soft tissue tumor .
fat tissue also is known as adipose tissue or lipoma .
but most people call it ball of fat under the skin .
it is not life threatening condition and is usually painless but it can become very unpleasant and is not pretty to look at .
lipomas can appear on any body part but usually affect the hands neck forehead torso and armpits .
the usual removal procedure involves surgery but you should know that the problem can also be treated naturally .
if you want to go through surgical procedure you might get these complications due to infections and the post surgical pain .
you will actually have wound after it and the pain might continue for days .
that why if you have lipoma you should treat it naturally and not put yourself under any kind of risk .
today we re going to show you few great recipes that are efficient and can eliminate the fat tissue in just few days .
for the preparation of these recipes you will need simple ingredients that are cheap and easily available .

in biology adipose tissue po or body fat or just fat is loose connective tissue composed mostly of adipocytes .
in addition to adipocytes adipose tissue contains the stromal vascular fraction svf of cells including preadipocytes fibroblasts vascular endothelial cells and variety of immune cells .
adipose tissue macrophages atms .
adipose tissue is derived from preadipocytes .
its main role is to store energy in the form of lipids although it also cushions and insulates the body .
far from hormonally inert adipose tissue has in recent years been recognized as major endocrine organ as it produces hormones such as leptin estrogen resistin and the cytokine tnf .
moreover adipose tissue can affect other organ systems of the body and may lead to disease .
obesity or being overweight in humans and most animals does not depend on body weight but on the amount of body fat to be specific adipose tissue .
the two types of adipose tissue are white adipose tissue wat and brown adipose tissue bat .
the formation of adipose tissue appears to be controlled in part by the adipose gene .
adipose tissue more specifically brown adipose tissue was first identified by the swiss naturalist conrad gessner in this video is targeted to blind users .

hope this information will helpful to get idea in brief about this .
the color comes from the large number of mitochondria in the cells which is where the heat is generated via uncoupling protein ucp .
white adipose tissue is what we more commonly call fat tissue its primary function is to store energy in the chemical form of long chain fats adipose tissue more specifically brown adipose tissue was first identified by the to regions of white adipose tissue which are found under the skin between the differences have been observed in comparing eat with subcutaneous fat below information will help you to get some more though about the subject white adipocytes white fat cells have single lipid droplet brown from what we can tell so far main differences between the two are white brown and white adipose tissues intrinsic differences in gene important differences exist between subcutaneous and visceral depots which mitochondria are functionally specialized in different tissues and detailed understanding of this specialization is important to elucidate anyway if you want for more info you would better continue reading .

non shivering thermogenesis occurs in brown adipose tissue brown fat that is present in all eutherians swine being the only exception currently known brown adipose tissue has unique protein thermogenin or ucp that allows the uncoupling of protons moving down their mitochondrial gradient from the synthesis of atp thus allowing the energy to be dissipated as heat .
in this process substances such as free fatty acids derived from triacylglycerols remove purine adp gdp and others inhibition of thermogenin uncoupling protein which causes an influx of into the matrix of the mitochondrion and bypasses the atp synthase channel .
this uncouples oxidative phosphorylation and the energy from the proton motive force is dissipated as heat rather than producing atp from adp which would store chemical energy for the body use .
thermogenesis can also be produced by leakage of the sodium potassium pump and the ca pump .
thermogenesis is contributioned to by futile cycles such as the simultaneous occurrence of lipogenesis and lipolysis or glycolysis and gluconeogenesis .
the low demands of thermogenesis mean that free fatty acids draw for the most part on lipolysis as the method of energy production .

cnn correspondent cristina alesci was diagnosed with type diabetes as an adult .
how is she coping .
holly firfer finds out .
type diabetes also know as adult onset diabetes non insulin dependent diabetes and niddm involves an abnormality with insulin resistance not lack of insulin .
it effects mostly adults but we are holly it in children as well due to obesity .
first off lets discuss what insulin actually does .
insulin is released by the pancreas in response to rise in blood sugar after meal .
the sugar without insulin would be trapped in the bloodstream and not be able to reach the body tissues to be used as energy .
think of insulin as picking up sugar out of the blood and putting it into the muscles and brain to be burnt for energy .
what happens in type diabetes is the muscles become insulin resistant .
the pancreas sees sugar in the bloodstream makes an insulin and the insulin picks up the sugar and tries to put it into the muscle but the muscle is resistant it wont let the sugar in .
now the pancreas in order to keep the blood sugar normal releases second insulin and the insulins are able to overcome the resistance of the muscle .
over time and with weight gain the muscles become more resistant and insulins are made to do the job then and so on .
the pancreas works harder and harder until eventually it cannot keep up and the sugar begins to get trapped in the blood and only then does the blood sugar start to rise above normal .
the time from the onset of insulin resistance to the point where the system is completely broken and diagnosis of diabetes is made can take up to years .
although there is problem one is not officially diagnosed as diabetic until their fasting sugar is above their hemoglobin is above meaning their sugar on average is points above normal or random or hour glucose test is above think of diabetes as year walk closer and closer to falling off cliff .
the day you are told you are diabetic is when you fell off the cliff .
the day before you were teatering at the edge so the actual diagnosis has been years in the making .
the good news is that with diet exercise and medications you can actually begin to walk away from the cliff .
one of the problems with insulin reasistance and type diabetes is that you have high insulin levels all the time .
insulin makes you hungry and it promotes fat storage .
when you drink alcohol your body inappropriately releases extra insulin .
this is what call the white castle effect .
after night of drinking and lots of calories injested already you find yourself starving at am and looking for food .
type diabetic literally is living their life like it am and they are in search of white castle .
ironically the more diabetic you are the higher your insulin levels the higher your insulin the hungrier you are the hungrier you are the more you eat the more you eat the higher your blood sugar the higher your blood sugar the more insulin you produce and the viscious cycle revolves .
the good news is starting medications even as pre diabetic can help to reverse the cycle and help you lose weight and become less of diabetic .
you can walk away from the cliff .
you need to find doctor that is proactive .
you need to look for clues that indicate you are heading for the cliff .
high triglycerides low hdl cholesterol fasting glucose between or belly greater than for woman or for man can all be indicators of pre diabetes .
you can ask your doctor to test fasting insulin level or peptide .
even better have them order hour glucose tolerance test with fasting and hour insulin level .

adults with lada may initially be diagnosed as having type diabetes based on their age particularly if they have risk factors for type diabetes such as strong family history or obesity .
the diagnosis is based on the finding of high blood sugar together with the clinical impression that islet failure rather than insulin resistance is the main cause detection of low peptide and raised antibodies against the islets of langerhans support the diagnosis .
it can only be treated with the usual oral treatments for type diabetes for certain period of time after which insulin treatment is usually necessary as well as long term monitoring for complications .
the concept of lada was first introduced in this video is targeted to blind users .

born in the us poet laureate donald hall has published essays and anthologies of both poetry and prose including string too short to be saved recollections of summers on new england farm and ox cart man children book which won the caldecott medal .
listener kendel currier transcript well we came here and we published books in the same year her first book of poems and my book called kicking the leaves and our second books came out the same year .
we always swore we wouldn come out the same year so we wouldn be reviewed together but we always did more or less .
it was it was maybe think it was when her second book which was kind of breakthrough the boat of quiet hours came out at the same time as book of mine called the happy man .
and the happy man the title of it took from some note by tolstoy in which he talked about the happy man and all happiness and he full of thoughts of suicide and it book with lot of depressing poems in but not entirely .
when told jane ve found title ve found title going to call it the happy man .
typical of jane she said it sounds too depressed .
and but anyway did call it the happy man .
but at there was at this time in my life as writer there was sort of physical and psychological element than the writing that have talked about in print and that is that when was about something like that became an adult onset diabetic and my diabetes is still with me and it very much under control and so on but it had the effect gradually in my of making it impossible for me to sustain an erection .
and this was depressing it was depressing for both of us of course and my poems suddenly turned kind of old and resigned and it was not was not in any deep depression but it was difficult for both of us and my poetry became sort of more passive or old and so on .
and think some of the poems are good that are in this mode but finally solved the problem by having penile implant surgery and potency came back .
was always always orgasmic but just couldn have an erection but got permanent one and it was wonderful and jane adored it and said kept saying perkins what you did for me and would point out it wasn just for her but at that same time my poems got back their liveliness and energy just because of bit of surgery but it very noticeable .
and it was noticeable in what lot of people think is the best thing ever did which was the book length poem .
to your health body and spirit reversing type diabetes through fasting type diabetes sometimes referred to as adult onset diabetes doesn have to be permanent .
fasting and calorie restriction can help you get control of your blood sugar lower your blood pressure and even help reverse type diabetes .
but before we get into how fasting can undo the damage of type diabetes we first need to understand how type diabetes affects the body .
how does type diabetes develop .
diabetes develops when fat accumulates in areas of the body that shouldn accumulate fat .
it all starts with an abundance of fat in your muscle tissue .
typically this is caused by family history poor diet or sedentary lifestyle .
this fat is called intramuscular fat .
it like the marbling on steak only it inside your muscles and it causes insulin resistance the characteristic that distinguishes type diabetes from type even worse intramuscular fat causes muscles to produce toxic fat metabolites like ceramide and diacylglycerol dag .
these toxins also contribute to insulin resistance high insulin levelslead to fatty liver when blood sugar is high the pancreas produces insulin to lower blood sugar .
however insulin resistance causes the liver to stop responding to insulin .
in fact the liver keeps producing sugar despite high level of sugar in the blood .
consuming food that high in sugar is like throwing gas on the fire and the abundance of sugar is converted to fat and stored in the liver .

trying to bring awareness to adults being diagnosed with type it isn only kids .
simon was diagnosed with late onset type diabetes when he was years old .
his motivation to really address his diet was weight gain but the result he now .
the idea of completely reversing diabetes has been questioned time and time again .
in order to determine the answer to this question you must take into account few factors such as what type of diabetes are you dealing with and whether or not your body is producing insulin .
typically doctors refer to diabetes reversal when you are able to go off your medication while engaging in healthy lifestyle program .
obviously when you are not taking medication for diabetes and your blood sugar is under control you do not have diabetes or you have reversed diabetes .
but the important message here is that you have to keep healthy lifestyle program .
if you fall off the wagon and start eating the wrong stuff again and stop exercising you will end up with diabetes yet again .
so to answer the question can type adult onset diabetes be reversed the answer is yes .
can it be reversed with diet and exercise .
absolutely yes .

little girl in texas had diet so unhealthy that she developed type diabetes before her fourth birthday doctor who treated her says .
the obese year old was diagnosed with what used to be known as adult onset diabetes which has become lot more common among children over the last few decades reports reuters .
in press release dr michael yafi pediatric endocrinologist at the university of texas says the pound toddler brought to his clinic had symptoms of excessive urination and thirst but her medical history was unremarkable and there was no family history of diabetes .
review of her diet however revealed poor family nutritional habits with uncontrolled counting of calories and fat yafi says .
the doctor who will present his research at global diabetes conference this week tells reuters that he has never encountered type diabetes patient so young before though he suspects there are more out there and he now screens all obese children for the condition .
luckily he was able to reverse the condition in the texas girl after catching it so early with the use of the diabetes drug metformin along with smaller portions of food and increased physical activity the girl lost weight her blood glucose levels returned to normal and she no longer had diabetes after six months the guardian reports .

the digital millennium copyright act extends this definition for further uses cells develop from hematopoietic stem cells hscs that originate from bone marrow .
hscs first differentiate into multipotent progenitor mpp cells then common lymphoid progenitor clp cells .
from here their development into cells occurs in several stages shown in image to the right each marked by various gene expression patterns and immunoglobulin chain and chain gene loci arrangements the latter due to cells undergoing recombination as they develop .
cells undergo two types of selection while developing in the bone marrow to ensure proper development .
positive selection occurs through antigen independent signaling involving both the pre bcr and the bcr .
if these receptors do not bind to their ligand cells do not receive the proper signals and cease to develop .
negative selection occurs through the binding of self antigen with the bcr if the bcr can bind strongly to self antigen then the cell undergoes one of four fates clonal deletion receptor editing anergy or ignorance cell ignores signal and continues development .
this negative selection process leads to state of central tolerance in which the mature cells don bind with self antigens present in the bone marrow .
to complete development into mature cells immature cells migrate from the bone marrow to the spleen as well as pass through two transitional stages and throughout their migration to the spleen and after spleen entry they are considered cells .
within the spleen cells transition to cells .
cells differentiate into either follicular fo cells or marginal zone mz cells depending on signals received through the bcr and other receptors .
once differentiated they are now considered mature cells or naive cells .

for more information log on to cell recognition of antigen is not the only element necessary for cell activation combination of clonal proliferation and terminal differentiation into plasma cells .
cells can be activated in cell dependent or independent manner .
cell dependent activation once pathogen is ingested by an antigen presenting cell such as macrophage or dendritic cell the pathogen proteins are then digested to peptides and attached to class ii mhc protein .
this complex is then moved to the outside of the cell membrane .
the macrophage is now activated to deliver multiple signals to specific cell that recognizes the peptide presented .
the cell is then stimulated to produce autocrines resulting in the proliferation or differentiation to effector or memory cells .
helper cells .
cd cells then activate specific cells through phenomenon known as an immunological synapse .
activated cells subsequently produce antibodies which assist in inhibiting pathogens until phagocytes .
macrophages neutrophils or the complement system for example clears the host of the pathogen .
most antigens are dependent meaning cell help is required for maximal antibody production .
with dependent antigen the first signal comes from antigen cross linking the cell receptor bcr and the second signal comes from co stimulation provided by cell .
dependent antigens contain proteins that are presented on cell class ii mhc to special subtype of cell called th cell .
when cell processes and presents the same antigen to the primed th cell the cell secretes cytokines that activate the cell .
these cytokines trigger cell proliferation and differentiation into plasma cells .
isotype switching to igg iga and ige and memory cell generation occur in response to dependent antigens .
this isotype switching is known as class switch recombination csr .
once this switch has occurred that particular cell will usually no longer make the earlier isotypes igm or igd .
cells undergo two types of selection while developing in the bone marrow to ensure proper development .
positive selection occurs through antigen independent signaling involving both the pre bcr and the bcr .
if these receptors do not bind to their ligand cells do not receive the proper signals and cease to develop .
negative selection occurs through the binding of self antigen with the bcr if the bcr can bind strongly to self antigen then the cell undergoes one of four fates clonal deletion receptor editing anergy or ignorance cell ignores signal and continues development .

genome wide association studies gwas have identified more than loci associated with genetic risk of type diabetes .
several candidate genes have been suggested or identified within these regions but the molecular mechanisms by which they contribute to insulitis and eta cell destruction remain to be clarified .
more than of the candidate genes are expressed in human pancreatic islets suggesting that they contribute to by regulating at least in part pathogenic mechanisms at the eta cell level .
recent studies by our group indicate that important genetically regulated pathways in eta cells include innate immunity and antiviral activity involving rig like receptors particularly mda and regulators of type ifns .

these observations reinforce the concept that the early pathogenesis of is characterized by dialog between the immune system and pancreatic eta cells .
this dialog is probably influenced by polymorphisms in genes expressed at the eta cell and or immune system level leading to inadequate responses to environmental cues such as viral infections .
our ongoing work aims to clarify how these disease associated variants affect pancreatic eta cell responses to inflammation and the subsequent triggering of autoimmune responses and the specific and progressive eta cell loss by apoptosis .

in this video we will tell you all the causes related to diabetes .
after the age of the population of islet cells is established and not plastic in man after age of years .
post mortem studies show that beta cell number at diagnosis of type diabetes is around percent and decreases to around after many years .
exposure of human islet to fatty acid causes an increase in intra islet fat storage and marker of apoptosis .
saturated cells contributed more in death of beta cells .
saturated lipids are harmful to beta cells .
the endocytosis of ldl can cause beta cell death as result of ros formation .
similarly prolonged elevation of circulating nefas by lipid infusion impairs pancreatic beta cell function in vivo particularly in individuals with genetic predisposition to type diabetes .
western diets rich in saturated fats cause obesity and insulin resistance and increase levels of circulating nefas .
in addition they contribute to beta cells failure in genetically predisposed individuals .
nefas cause beta cell apoptosis and may thus contribute to progressive beta cell loss in type diabetes .
type diabetes is characterized by defects in both insulin secretion and insulin action .
sfa ingestion reduced insulin sensitivity .
insulin secretion failed to compensate for insulin resistance in subjects who ingested sfa .
failure of insulin secretion to compensate for insulin resistance implies impaired beta cell function in the sfa .
increased consumption of sfas has powerful short and long term effect on insulin action .
saturated fats are harmful to insulin .
environmental factors such as diets rich in saturated fats contribute to dysfunction and death of pancreatic cells in diabetes .

type diabetes currently affects of the uk adult population and is one of the foremost health challenges currently facing society .
this syndrome can be described as failure of the pancreatic beta cell mass to secrete sufficient insulin to counteract elevated blood glucose levels .
it is largely believed that all beta cells are the same .
however recent studies have shown that beta cells in fact comprise discrete subpopulations some of which may contribute to insulin secretion and more than others .
this presentation will highlight the methodology that has allowed us to redefine how beta cells and more generally endocrine cells function .
the influence of subtle differences in the beta cell barcode on insulin release in health and disease will then be examined .
finally new techniques which may provide unprecedented insight into and drug development will be discussed .
beta cell failure is dominant .
heal your pancreas naturally with these foods the pancreas is really the life saver in all of us .
it plays very important role for your health and well being .
it produces your insulin .
if it is damaged you will not get insulin .
without insulin your glucose metabolism suffers .
your body cells cannot produce energy from food .
the pancreas plays crucial role in digestion .
when food empties from your stomach into the small intestine it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas that neutralize stomach acid preventing damage to the intestine .
these enzymes are also essential for your body to reduce inflammation caused by trauma injury allergens toxins and infections .
but most importantly the pancreas produces insulin which reduces blood sugar levels and allows your body to store food energy for future use .
eating the right foods can heal and nourish your pancreas .
foods that heal the pancreas probiotic yogurt research finds that eating servings of low fat or fat free yogurt that contains active cultures to help ease digestion protect the pancreas and digestive system and reduce the overall risk of pancreatic cancer .
cabbage regular consumption of cabbage may help protect susceptible individuals against pancreatic cancer .
cabbage is loaded with vitamin but it also contains vitamin and folate .
spinach the pancreas needs both iron and vitamin to function properly and spinach has both .
pancreas that is properly nourished will be less likely to become inflamed or to be vulnerable to the onset of cancer .
licorice licorice root is an excellent treatment for many problems with pancreas .
traditional chinese used licorice root for thousands of years .
research even shows that this common root is loaded with an anti inflammatory compound that reduces pain and swelling that is associated with pancreatitis .
cherries it really hard to eat just handful of cherries which is great news since the fruit is rich in antioxidants and perillyl alcohol or poh compound that been linked to the prevention of pancreatic cancer .
garlic this is major help for the pancreas .
garlic reduces the amount of sugar in the blood and stimulates the pancreas to produce sufficient levels of insulin .
aim to eat one to two slightly crushed cloves of garlic each day in addition to adding some to your foods .
red reishi mushrooms used in china for thousands of years to restore balance inside the body red rishi mushrooms reduce inflammation and have similar benefits of onions and garlic for pancreatic health .
if are hard to find in your local grocery store try the asian foods section at specialty grocery store .
sweet potatoes sweet potatoes along with other orange and yellow vegetables like carrots corn and squash contain nutrients which are beneficial for the pancreas and may help prevent cancer .
other foods that also heal the pancreas are blueberries broccoli red grapes and tomato vegetable soup .
because the pancreas is very easily damaged by an unhealthy diet eating these certain food will boost its health .
sources glad to have you watching .
good day and good health .

human endocrine system pancreas pancreas is mixed gland portion of pancreas acts like exocrine gland and another portion acts like an endocrine gland .
the cells of endocrine pancreas are called islets of langerhangs representing to of pancreatic tissue .
they secrete hormones insulin and glucagon insulin the hormone is produced by cells of islet of langerhangs .
it is peptide hormone which plays major role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis .
insulin promotes the conversion of glucose to glycogen in liver and muscle that is stored in these tissue for future use .
insulin is liberated when the blood glucose levels are high usually when food is digested and absorbed .
if sufficient insulin is not produced glucose level in blood increases and it is excreted through urine .
this is called diabetes mellitus .
diabetes is identified by the presence of sugar in urine .
diabetic patients take insulin injections regularly .
insulin also affects the metabolism of fats and proteins .
unattended diabetis results in wasting of body tissue reduced healing power ketone bodies blurred vision and kidney problems .
they may end up with gangrene and coma glucagon is peptide hormone secreted by cells of islets of langerhans .
glucagon acts on liver cells and stimulates glyconeolysis resulting in an increased blood sugar hyperglycemia .
this hormone stimulates the process of gluconeogenesis which also contributes to hyperglycemia .
glucagon reduces the cellular glucose uptake and utilization .
thus glucagon is hyperglycemic hormone .

people with type diabetes may develop complications from long term use of insulin and develop hypoglycemia or severe low blood sugar .
now researchers have developed therapy that may help protect type diabetics from this life threatening condition .
alpha and beta cells are involved in healthy functioning of your pancreas and in regulating insulin levels .
based on ocr level knowledge .
here try to explain the process of insulin secretion as quickly and concisely as possible .
this is based on the ocr scheme of work and is designed to either get you started or to help you revise .
fastest explanation of beta cell function in the islets of langerhans .
this whole process takes place in the pancreas which is an interesting organ as it serves endocrine and exocrine functions .
exocrine cells secrete proteins usually enzymes into ducts .
endocrine cells secrete hormones directly into the blood .

this video covers the gross structure of the pancreas including acini islets of langerhans and its constituent alpha and beta cells discussing its exocrine and endocrine functions along the way .
we ll then look at the mechanism by which insulin is released from beta cells .
insulin is the principal hormone that regulates the uptake of glucose from the blood into most cells of the body especially liver muscle and adipose tissue .
therefore deficiency of insulin or the insensitivity of its receptors plays central role in all forms of diabetes mellitus .
the body obtains glucose from three main places the intestinal absorption of food the breakdown of glycogen the storage form of glucose found in the liver and gluconeogenesis the generation of glucose from non carbohydrate substrates in the body .
insulin plays critical role in balancing glucose levels in the body .
insulin can inhibit the breakdown of glycogen or the process of gluconeogenesis it can stimulate the transport of glucose into fat and muscle cells and it can stimulate the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen .
insulin is released into the blood by beta cells cells found in the islets of langerhans in the pancreas in response to rising levels of blood glucose typically after eating .
insulin is used by about two thirds of the body cells to absorb glucose from the blood for use as fuel for conversion to other needed molecules or for storage .
lower glucose levels result in decreased insulin release from the beta cells and in the breakdown of glycogen to glucose .
this process is mainly controlled by the hormone glucagon which acts in the opposite manner to insulin .
if the amount of insulin available is insufficient if cells respond poorly to the effects of insulin insulin insensitivity or insulin resistance or if the insulin itself is defective then glucose will not be absorbed properly by the body cells that require it and it will not be stored appropriately in the liver and muscles .
the net effect is persistently high levels of blood glucose poor protein synthesis and other metabolic derangements such as acidosis .
when the glucose concentration in the blood remains high over time the kidneys will reach threshold of reabsorption and glucose will be excreted in the urine glycosuria this increases the osmotic pressure of the urine and inhibits reabsorption of water by the kidney resulting in increased urine production polyuria and increased fluid loss .
lost blood volume will be replaced osmotically from water held in body cells and other body compartments causing dehydration and increased thirst polydipsia .

the pancreas the pancreas is shown here with the foreground highly magnified to reveal its inner anatomy .
ninety nine percent of pancreatic tissue is composed of acinar glands which secrete an alkaline digestive juice into the duodenum via the pancreatic duct to help digest food .
the endocrine areas of the pancreas known as the islets of langerhans are composed of two major types of cell .
the alpha cells secrete the hormone glucagon and the beta cells secrete insulin into the bloodstream .
these hormones work in opposition to control the blood glucose level .
insulin promotes the uptake and usage of glucose in the tissues particularly skeletal muscle and fat and reduces glucose production in the liver .
glucagon has an anti insulin effect in the liver increasing glucose release .
the anatomy of the pancreas also includes the ampulla of the common bile duct the pancreatic duct which carries digestive juice containing enzymes to the duodenum the acini the exocrine portions of the pancreas which secrete digestive juice into the pancreas the splenic arteries which conduct oxygenated blood into the pancreas and the mesenteric veins which carry deoxygenated blood containing insulin and glucagon away from the pancreas .
developed at loughborough university in partnership with the institute of cellular medicine at newcastle university the technology will provide optimal storage and transportation conditions for donated cells as well as automated delivery .

how pancreatic beta cells release insulin .
three important transporters on the pancreatic beta cell that participate in the regulation of insulin secretion glut glucose transporter potassium channel voltage gated calcium channel .
the glut transporter has high km value and therefore sensitive only when there high level of glucose in the blood .
when the glucose concentration in the blood is high glut transporter on the beta cells opens up and facilitated the uptake of glucose from the blood into the beta cells .
inside the beta cells glucose will undergoes glycolysis and increase the production of atp inside the beta cell .
increase level of atp inside the cell causes the potassium channel to closes .
normally the potassium channel in the beta cells pumps potassium from inside the cell out to the extracellular compartment .
because increases in atp closes the potassium pump potassium will build up inside the cell .
the build up of positive charge potassium causes the membrane to depolarize becomes less negative this depolarization opens up the voltage gated calcium channel .
once the voltage gated calcium channel opens calcium rushs into the beta cell .
increase intracellular calcium serves as second messenger to stimulate the release of insulin from the beta cell .
clinical correlation sulfonylureas mechanism of action function similar to an increase in atp within the pancreatic beta cells in causes the potassium channel to close increase intracellular potassium concentration depolarization of the plasma membrane this opens the voltage gated calcium channel increase in the influx of calcium into the cell calcium then acts as second messenger that will stimulate the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells .
neonatal diabetes there is mutation in the kcnj gene this gene encodes for the subunit of the potassium channel .
the mutation keeps the channel opens therefore more potassium is efflux from the cell and unable to accumulate within the beta pancreatic cells .
beta pancreatic cell does not depolarize and does not stimulate voltage gated calcium channel to open therefore it disrupt the release of insulin from pancreas .
tried my best to explain these concepts to the best of my knowledge and made it as simple as possible .

alpha cells secrete glucagon beta cells secrete insulin and delta cells secrete somatostatin .
insulin generally speaking insulin is designed for energy abundance .
so your body prefers to use glucose rather than fats for energy .
the body will use ch instead of fat and glycogen .
and use amino acids for protein synthesis .
glucose muscle will have increase uptake to make glycogen in the muscle .
in the liver it will be used for uptake to use for glycogen and fat .
brain will only use glucose and this is independent of insulin .
fat increase fat storage .
increase citrate and isocitrate .
increase acetylcoa carboxylase .
this increase malonyl coa which will increase fat synthesis .
this will increase lipoprotein lilpase and decrease lipase .
in deficiency you prefer fats so you increase lipoprotein lipase which increase free fatty acids .
this will become phospholipids and cholesterol leading to heart disease .
when there is free fatty acids without insulin this will increase ketone bodies acetoacetic acid and hydroxyacetate .
protein increase synthesis and storage of protein .
increase aa and increase protein synthesis .
in deficiency there is increase serum aa and increase urea in urine .
it also increase effect on growth hormone .
mechanism of action of beta cell when glucose comes in this increases atp and blocks potassium channel .
this depolarizes and causes opening of calcium channel .
regulated by glucose amino acids and git hormones .
glucagon this hormone is expressed when glucose is low .
therefore it will increase gluconeogenesis by converting amino acids into glucose and converted fats into glucose .
increase camp which will increase phorphokinase which will increase phorphorylase and increase glucose phosphate .
only small amount of glucose is necessary to have greater effects because of amplification .
at really high concentrations it can increase heart contraction increase blood flow to organs increase bile secretion an block gastric acid .
somatostatin regulated by high glucose amino acids fatty acids and git hormones .
effects of somatostatin decrease insulin and glucagon .
decreases motility of duodenum stomach and gallbladder .

the islet pathophysiology group focuses on defining the mechanisms underlying pancreatic islet malfunction and decreased beta cell mass in type diabetes .
the disease has in recent years been associated to variations in large number of genes .
the big challenge is to understand exactly how these genetic variations affect cellular functions in the pancreatic islets in order to identify targets for causative treatment .
focus areas include the role of the redox environment with particular focus on effectors of nadph and their consequences for beta cell function and survival .
the role of complement proteins of the innate immune system for control of insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cell in health and disease .
this is done in collaborate with the group of anna blom lund university and other international collaborators .
ion channels in particular voltage gated ca channels and their role in type diabetes in collaboration with some of the leading profiles in the area .
methods used include the patch clamp technique in combination with microfluorimetry or cellular imaging techniques such as confocal or tirf imaging .
imaging methods established include multiphoton imaging and fluorescence spectrum correlation .
in addition we perform hormone release assays immunocytochemistry standard biochemistry and manipulation of gene expression using rna interference or viral transfer methods .
in an effort to go beyond the single gene one function paradigm and do develop models that take into account the contribution of several genes and their encoded proteins for the altered cellular functions that predispose for type diabetes and how aberrations in these networks can be corrected by novel treatmentts .
to do this we analyse gene regulatory co expression networdks in pancreatic islets followed by functional validation experiments down to detailed molecular level when appropriate .
an important aspect of protein function is their interactions addressed by discovery techniques hybrid systems and focused low throughput methods .
immunoprecipitation affinity purification including those that make it possible to characterize interactions in real time fluctuation correlation spectroscopy .
after discovery and validation the ultimate goal is to translate findings into improved diagnostics and novel molecular targets for treatment of type diabetes .

how to reverse diabetes .
turns out the diabetes industry is selling us fake research .
hi .
robo suzie and today ll talk to you about is the pancreatic islet transplantation feasible cure for diabetes .
also don forget to check out the link below to find out how this guy reversed his diabetes .
turns out the diabetes industry is selling us fake research .
but back to our topic .
the pancreatic islet transplantation or what is known as the edmonton protocol is an experimental procedure that makes use of islets extracted from the pancreas of recently deceased organ donor .
the process involves the transplant of said islets to patient suffering from diabetes type the beta cells of these transplanted islets are expected to produce the insulin lacked by the type diabetes patient .
this experiment then hopes to provide the cure for diabetes mellitus .
diabetes type is that diabetic condition where the beta cells of the pancreas is unable to produce insulin as result of the attacks launched by the body immune system .
the transplantation of islet therefore is expected to provide cure for diabetes type patients which will enable them to live normal life free from insulin dependence .
although the diabetes type condition deals with insulin resistance it has been noted that the diabetic condition of the patient will also develop to insulin decline or progress later on as diabetes type many supporters of the pancreatic islet transplantation believe that this will also be cure for diabetes type to relieve sufferers of their eventual need for insulin injections .
the islets referred to here are the cluster of cells or tissues known in the medical world as islets of langerhans .
these islets are microscopic and are scattered throughout the pancreas forming part of the endocrine glands .
they contain the cells which secret the beta cells that produce the insulin necessary for glucose absorption and any failure of these islets to produce these beta cells lead to diabetes mellitus or type diabetes .
although clinically promising at first year follow up after the transplantation procedure was made and the results were not as favourable as expected .
only ten percent of the patients remained free of insulin dependence while the rest went back to the use of insulin shots since the transplanted islets eventually lost its ability to produce insulin .
the only benefits that the latter group of patients gained was their less demand for insulin since the patients were able to achieve glucose stability .
hence to date pancreatic transplantation has not gained the medical support as the ultimate cure for diabetes .
it is also believed that the eventual failure of the transplanted islet to produce insulin was also attributed to the body immune system .
the beta cells produced by the transplanted islets were also attacked by the body immune system .
hence in the same way that the natural beta cells of the body were impaired the patient still suffers from diabetes mellitus or diabetes type critics say that it was actually project doomed from the beginning others pointed out that the root of the insulin impairment problem was the inability of the immune system to recognize insulin beta cells as essential to digestive functions instead of treating these insulin cells as bacteria .
perhaps further experimentations therefore in the search for the elusive cure for diabetes should have more concern in orienting the auto immune system on how to recognize friendly and non friendly substances found in the body .

pancreatic islet transplantation represents promising treatment for patients with but shortage of available healthy islet donors means that there is an insufficient supply of insulin producing islets to meet the demands for such therapies .
thus research efforts over the last decade have focused on generating artificial islets from human pluripotent stem cells hpscs as prospective solution to this scarcity .
while these studies have yielded impressive results current methods are still incapable of producing functional islets that fully recapitulate the activity and glucose responsiveness of normal human islets .

diabetes refers to group of conditions characterized by high level of blood glucose commonly referred to as blood sugar .
too much sugar in the blood can cause serious sometimes life threatening health problems .
there are two types of chronic diabetic conditions type diabetes and type diabetes .
pregnant women may acquire transient form of the disease called gestational diabetes which usually resolves after the birth of baby .
pre diabetes is when the blood sugar level is at the borderline higher than normal but lower than in diabetics .
prediabetes may or may not progress to diabetes .
during food digestion carbohydrates or carb break down into glucose which is carried by the bloodstream to various organs of the body .
here it is either consumed as an energy source in muscles for example or is stored for later use in the liver .
insulin is hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas and is necessary for glucose intake by target cells .
in other words when insulin is deficient muscle or liver cells are unable to use or store glucose and as result glucose accumulates in the blood .
in healthy people beta cells of the pancreas produce insulin insulin binds to its receptor on target cells and induces glucose intake .
in type diabetes beta cells of the pancreas are destroyed by the immune system by mistake .
the reason why this happens is unclear but genetic factors are believed to play major role .
insulin production is reduced less insulin binds to its receptor on target cells less glucose is taken into the cells more glucose stays in the blood .
type is characterized by early onset symptoms commonly start suddenly and before the age of type diabetes is normally managed with insulin injection .
type diabetics are therefore insulin dependent .
in type diabetes the pancreas produces enough insulin but something goes wrong either with receptor binding or insulin signaling inside the target cells .
the cells are not responsive to insulin and therefore cannot import glucose glucose stays in the blood .
in other words type diabetics are insulin resistant .
here again genetic factors predispose susceptibility to the disease but it is believed that lifestyle plays very important role in type typically obesity inactive lifestyle and unhealthy diet are associated with higher risk of type diabetes .
type is characterized by adult onset symptoms usually appear gradually and start after the age of type diabetes accounts for about to of all diabetics .
management focuses on weight loss and includes low carb diet .

more and more people are suffering from type diabetes due to variety of reasons including diet exercise and genetics .

more and more people are suffering from type diabetes due to variety of reasons including diet exercise and genetics .
according to new study from researchers at harvard medical school in massachusetts working with an expert from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in germany genetic predisposition for diabetes in latin american populations might be related to gene variant passed down from neanderthals .
genome wide association study that analyzed the genes of thousand mexicans and other latin americans shows that subjects who have the gene are percent more likely to have diabetes and people who have versions of the gene from both parents are percent more likely to get diabetes .
around percent of east asians have the gene variant but it is rarely found in european or african populations .
neanderthals went extinct around thousand years ago but they are believed to have interbred with other human species based on genetic evidence from remains found in denisova cave in siberia .
percent of non african human genomes are reportedly made up of neanderthal dna .
what do you think about the predisposition for diabetes being connected with genes from neanderthals .
genisyss http www genisyss com helps the average person store their dna and keep it in their own possession .
why .
because dna changes over lifetime of exposure to the sun radiation pollution chemicals smoking and even stress .
today dna is used to identify predispositions to medical conditions including cancer heart disease diabetes autism tourette and many others .
by identifying this early and staying mindful your stored dna from earlier in your life or your parent may be used to treat and prevent the expression of any diseases that show up in your dna .
in this video talk about epigenetics .
this is the study of the factors that turn on or off gene expression .
when we see doctor they will want to know your family medical history .
they do this to find out if you are predisposed to disease by genetics ie if your mother had diabetes there is high chance you will too .
what research regarding epigenetics has found is that even though you have predisposition to an illness disease that gene can be silenced or actioned by diet stress lifestyle environmental factors .
alot of our habits we learnt was when we were children were learnt from our parents or caregivers .
so if we live our lives using these habits we learnt from our parents we will most likely action that gene .
while if we change our habits lets say better diet we can silence that gene and not manifest that illness .

an excerpt from the audiobook the language of god scientist presents evidence for belief by physician geneticist francis collins appendix section of disc tracks .
transcript according to the national institute of health about of people with type diabetes are overweight or obese .
without doubt obesity is major risk factor for type diabetes because increased body fat makes it difficult for the body to use insulin properly .
does this mean that diabetes is just disease of the obese .
unfortunately being skinny is not always protection against diabetes .
many who do not fit the typical physical description of diabetic overweight and older can get diabetes .
although increased body weight is risk factor for diabetes it is not the only risk factor .
lean people can be at risk for type diabetes for other reasons not directly related to body weight .
this risk however is low especially in comparison to obese individuals .
it in the genes aside from commonly known risk factors for diabetes such as excess weight and old age there are two strong risk factors for diabetes that are often overlooked genes and family history .
some people are born more likely to have diabetes regardless of their weight .
in fact according to the american diabetes association type diabetes has stronger link to family history than type diabetes especially in twins .
if one twin has type the other twin risk is up to .
research study published in plos genetics found that most lean cases are people with strong genetic predisposition for type diabetes .
even family history of heart disease can increase person risk for diabetes .
lifestyle it important to note that in the field of health and nutrition the word skinny does not always mean healthy .
even relatively skinny person can have poor diet and low activity levels .
unhealthy lifestyle choices can increase the risk for diabetes .
low physical activity encourages insulin resistance .
coupled with poor diet sedentary lifestyle can lead to increased body fat especially dangerous type of body fat called visceral fat .
this type of fat is not the fat found under the skin .
this is the fat that surrounds internal organs especially around the waist area .
such poor lifestyle choices increase the risk of hypertension high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels in the blood .
all of these health problems can encourage the development of type diabetes as well .
smoking can also increase your risk for type diabetes regardless of your body weight .
according to the american journal of epidemiology heavy smoker cigarettes day has risk for type diabetes three times greater than that of non smoker .
specific populations research has shown that certain population groups are more susceptible to diabetes than others .
for example thin cases of diabetes are more common in the elderly or certain non caucasian ethnicities .
these include african americans native americans hispanic latino americans asian americans and pacific islanders .
since these ethnic backgrounds are more vulnerable to diabetes body weight may not make huge difference in the risk for diabetes .
during pregnancy women can develop temporary type of diabetes called gestational diabetes .
if this occurs their chances of developing type diabetes are higher for the next decade or so regardless of their weight .
if woman gave birth to at least one baby weighing more than pounds she is at increased risk for developing type diabetes regardless of her weight or family history .
understand diabetes to prevent or delay it there are overweight people without diabetes and thin people with diabetes .
however the diabetes epidemic nationally and globally lies mainly but not exclusively in obese individuals .
according to study published in diabetology amp metabolic syndrome the risk of developing type diabetes for overweight people is about times higher than normal weight individuals .
many of the risk factors for type diabetes in lean people are out of their control such as family history or genes .
weight on the other hand is factor that can be controlled .
if you are at risk for type diabetes weight loss is an important measure to take to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes .
the facts show that people can develop type diabetes at any age or weight even during childhood or in lean person .
however this type of diabetes develops most often in middle aged and older people .
regardless of the risk factors you may or may not have it is important to recognize the warning signs of diabetes and to make healthy lifestyle choices that can help prevent it .
aidan power at pfizer speculates about obesity and diabetes genes and whether behavioral changes can trounce our biology .
we all have heard about the thrifty genes .
but what are the various other factors that lead to diabetes and how to keep them at bay .
dr jaydeep shinde tells us about the need to reckon with diabetes even before its onset so that we can postpone the related complications effectively .

how to reverse diabetes .
turns out the diabetes industry is selling us fake research .
hi .
robo suzie and today ll talk to you about diabetes african americans deadly foe .
also don forget to check out the link below to find out how this guy reversed his diabetes .
turns out the diabetes industry is selling us fake research .
but back to our topic .
diabetes is having devastating effect on the african american community .
diabetes is the fifth leading cause of death in african americans and their death rates are twenty seven percent higher than whites .
over million african americans have diabetes and one third of them don know they have the disease .
in addition twenty five percent of african americans between the ages of have diabetes and one in four african american women over the age of have been diagnosed with the disease the cause of diabetes is mystery but researchers believe that both genetics and environmental factors play roles in who will develop the disease .
heredity .
researchers believe that african americans and african immigrants are predisposed to developing diabetes .
research suggests that african americans and recent african immigrants have inherited thrifty gene from their african ancestors .
this gene may have enabled africans to use food energy more efficiently during cycles of feast and famine .
now with fewer cycles of feast and famine this gene may make weight control more difficult for african americans and african immigrants .
this genetic predisposition coupled with impaired glucose tolerance is often associated with the genetic tendency toward high blood pressure .
people with impaired glucose tolerance have higher than normal blood glucose levels and are at higher risk for developing diabetes .
what is diabetes .
diabetes commonly know as sugar diabetes is condition that occurs when the body is unable to properly produce or use insulin .
insulin is needed by the body to process sugar starches and other foods into energy .
diabetes is chronic condition for which there is no known cure diabetes is serious disease and should not be ignored .
diabetics often suffer from low glucose levels sugar in their blood .
low blood sugar levels can make you disorientated dizzy sweaty hungry have headaches have sudden mood swings have difficulty paying attention or have tingling sensations around the mouth .
types of diabetes .
pre diabetes is condition that occurs when person blood glucose levels is higher than normal but not high enough for diagnosis of type diabetes .
pre diabetes can cause damage to the heart and circulatory system but pre diabetes can often be controlled by controlling blood glucose levels .
by controlling pre diabetes you can often prevent or delay the onset of type diabetes .
type or juvenile onset diabetes usually strikes people under the age of but can strike at any age .
five to ten percent of african americans who are diagnosed with diabetes are diagnosed with this type of the disease .
type diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body produces little or no insulin and this type of disease must be treated with daily insulin injections .
type or adult onset diabetes is responsible for ninety to ninety five percent of diagnosed diabetes cases in african americans .
type results from condition where the body fails to properly use insulin .
according to the american diabetes association type is usually found in people over who have diabetes in their family who are overweight who don exercise and who have cholesterol problems .
in the early stages it can often be controlled with lifestyle changes but in the later stages diabetic pills or insulin injections are often needed .
pregnancy related diabetes or gestational diabetes can occur in pregnant women .
gestational diabetes is often associated with high glucose blood levels or hyperglycemia .
gestational diabetes affects about four percent of all pregnant women .
the disease usually goes away after delivery but women who suffer from gestational diabetes are at higher risk for developing diabetes later in life .
symptoms of diabetes .
the most common symptoms of diabetes include excessive urination including frequent trips to the bathroom .
increased thirst .
increased appetite .
blurred vision .
unusual weight loss .
increased fatigue .
irritability .
complications from diabetes .
diabetes can lead to many disabling and life threatening complications .
strokes blindness kidney failure heart disease and amputations are common complications that effect african americans who have diabetes kidney disease .
diabetes is the second leading cause of end stage kidney disease in african americans accounting for about thirty percent of the new cases each year says the national kidney foundation of illinois .
up to twenty one percent of people who develop diabetes will develop kidney disease .

visit cure to know more is diabetes genetic you ve probably wondered how you developed diabetes .
you may worry that your children will develop it too .
unlike some traits diabetes does not seem to be inherited in simple pattern .
yet clearly some people are born more likely to develop diabetes than others .
what leads to diabetes .
type and type diabetes have different causes .
yet two factors are important in both .
you inherit predisposition to the disease then something in your environment triggers it .
genes alone are not enough .
one proof of this is identical twins .
identical twins have identical genes .
yet when one twin has type diabetes the other gets the disease at most only half the time .
when one twin has type diabetes the other risk is at most in type diabetes in most cases of type diabetes people need to inherit risk factors from both parents .
we think these factors must be more common in whites because whites have the highest rate of type diabetes .
because most people who are at risk do not get diabetes researchers want to find out what the environmental triggers are .
one trigger might be related to cold weather .
type diabetes develops more often in winter than summer and is more common in places with cold climates .
another trigger might be viruses .
perhaps virus that has only mild effects on most people triggers type diabetes in others .
early diet may also play role .
type diabetes is less common in people who were breastfed and in those who first ate solid foods at later ages .
in many people the development of type diabetes seems to take many years .
in experiments that followed relatives of people with type diabetes researchers found that most of those who later got diabetes had certain autoantibodies in their blood for years before .
antibodies are proteins that destroy bacteria or viruses .
autoantibodies are antibodies gone bad which attack the body own tissues .
type diabetes type diabetes has stronger link to family history and lineage than type although it too depends on environmental factors .
studies of twins have shown that genetics play very strong role in the development of type diabetes .
lifestyle also influences the development of type diabetes .
obesity tends to run in families and families tend to have similar eating and exercise habits .
if you have family history of type diabetes it may be difficult to figure out whether your diabetes is due to lifestyle factors or genetic susceptibility .
most likely it is due to both .
however don lose heart .
studies show that it is possible to delay or prevent type diabetes by exercising and losing weight .

ental scientists first turned their attention to understanding the biologic plausibility of how periodontitis might confer risk for systemic disease .
cardiovascular diseases cvd primarily are result of atherosclerosis and are the number one cause of mortality worldwide .
increasing evidence over the past decade suggests that severe periodontal disease is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk .
several possible mechanisms may operate independently or in concert to explain this association .
the mechanisms resulting in pathology from both periodontitis and cvd are similar both diseases have complex causation that includes genetic and gender predispositions age diabetes smoking social status and stress .
periodontal infections may directly contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and thromboembolicevents by providing repeated systemic challenges with lps and inflammatory cytokines .
the oral cavity of individuals with periodontitis represents potentially large reservoir of gram negative pathogenic organisms that can penetrate gingival tissues enter the circulation and contribute to atherosclerosis progression .
the possible relationship between infectious diseases and the genesis of atherosclerosis remains hypothetical .
it is important todistinguish between the potential role of infectious diseases in atherogenesis and the possibility that infection may enhance smoldering inflammatory process that is already present in atheromatous plaques .

type diabetes is the fastest growing disease affecting million people worldwide and the number is predicted to double within the next years .
is assumed to develop from the interaction between genetic predisposition and an affluent environment .
diabetes is clearly much more heterogeneous disease than the simple subdivision into type and type diabetes assumes .
dissection of the genetic heterogeneity of diabetes is prerequisite for the development of individualized treatment as well as to identify new targets for more efficient therapy .
in addition identification of disease susceptibility genes kicks off possibilities to study gene environment interactions .
to accomplish this task different strategies are being adopted including genome wide association studies gwas next generation sequencing expression profiling of target tissues human islets muscle fat and liver as well as studies of epigenetic modifications dna and histone methylation acetylation etc .
prerequisite for these studies is access to some of the largest and best characterized populations in the field including the botnia study the malm diet and cancer study etc .
these studies allow exploration of gene environment diet and exercise interactions as well as prediction of disease development and progression .

let me begin by saying categorically that at the time of this video there is no cure for diabetes .
diabetes management book there are literally thousands of claims out there saying their product or their program can cure your diabetes .
simply put they cannot .
but this question asks if diabetes can be reversed .
so to begin this conversation we need to define what we mean by reversed .
if we are saying we can take our bodies back to the time before we had diabetes then no .
if we are talking about state in which we can control our blood sugar without the use of any medications then the answer is maybe .
let talk about those with type diabetes first .
if you have type then you are insulin dependent .
when you were first diagnosed you may have gone through what is called honeymoon period in which your blood sugar kept dropping and dropping and you used less and less insulin .
you may have even stopped using it altogether .
by the way researchers now feel that type need to continue small insulin injections to protect what insulin producing cells they still have .
but this honeymoon period will not last forever .
if you have type diabetes then approximately of your insulin producing cells have been destroyed .
they have not been damaged with chance of repair they are gone .
it is impossible to reverse the damage done .
while some think their diabetes has been cured or even reversed this is false sense of security .
the process that destroyed the of insulin producing cells with destroy the remaining .
ultimately you will be totally dependent on insulin .
type diabetes cannot be reversed .
and this is not my opinion it is the opinion of the foremost diabetes center in the world the joslin diabetes center in boston .
as far as type diabetes as long as we are clear on the definition of reversal will say it is possible .
remember am adamant about the fact that there is no cure for diabetes but do feel it is possible for person with type to be able to go off their diabetes meds for time and control their blood sugar .
that would be reversal .
we cannot go back and reverse the damage done by having diabetes but it is possible to control diabetes without medication .
the most recent reliable research could find on this subject was conducted in march of it was conducted professor roy taylor professor of medicine and metabolism at newcastle university in new castle england .
the work was an extension of study that was in question because of the brevity of the study .
that study had theory that this research is part of growing body of evidence showing that people with type diabetes who successfully lose weight can reverse their condition because fat is removed from their pancreas returning insulin production to normal in the study volunteers with type went on strict diet of calories per day for months .
now let me warn you right now that is not lot of food in calories .
however the participants lost an average of pounds .
they had to keep this weight off for another months .
the results were that of those with type who had been diagnosed less than years reversed their diabetes .
for those who had been diagnosed longer did not have the same results .
the key to reversing diabetes is to lose weight and regular exercise .
in another study discussed by michael dansinger md those with type exercised for minutes week limited their calories to to per day and got weekly counseling and education on these lifestyle changes .
within year about got off their diabetes medications or improved to the point where their blood sugar level was no longer in the diabetes range and was instead classified as prediabetes in every study researched it was apparent that the numbers of those who were able to reverse their diabetes were largely dependent on the date of diagnosis .
those who were newbies had better chance of reversal .
but even at that the average of those who have been able to reverse their diabetes has been about .
weight loss and exercise will not work for everyone .
part of that reason is that some people are simply predisposed to diabetes .
it in your genes .
the reason we also call this reversal rather than cure .
for those who have experienced reversal and then gained their weight back guess what happens .
they need to start their diabetes meds again .
can attest to that first hand .
as pound man was in bad shape in more ways that one .
dropped pounds on fad diet .
it was great .
no longer needed any diabetes meds felt awesome and this went on for about years .
but then the diet was on started affecting other parts of my body .
got very ill was told had to stop the fad diet and try to return to normal diet or something bad was going to happen .
what is thrifty gene hypothesis .
what does thrifty gene hypothesis mean .
thrifty gene hypothesis meaning thrifty gene hypothesis definition thrifty gene hypothesis explanation .
source wikipedia org article adapted under license .
the thrifty gene hypothesis or gianfranco hypothesis is an attempt by geneticist james neel to explain why certain populations and subpopulations in the modern day are prone to diabetes mellitus type he proposed the hypothesis in to resolve fundamental problem diabetes is clearly very harmful medical condition yet it is quite common and it was already evident to neel that it likely had strong genetic basis .
the problem is to understand how disease with likely genetic component and with such negative effects may have been favoured by the process of natural selection .
neel suggested the resolution to this problem is that genes which predispose to diabetes called thrifty genes were historically advantageous but they became detrimental in the modern world .
in his words they were rendered detrimental by progress .
neel primary interest was in diabetes but the idea was soon expanded to encompass obesity as well .
thrifty genes are genes which enable individuals to efficiently collect and process food to deposit fat during periods of food abundance in order to provide for periods of food shortage feast and famine .
according to the hypothesis the thrifty genotype would have been advantageous for hunter gatherer populations especially child bearing women because it would allow them to fatten more quickly during times of abundance .
fatter individuals carrying the thrifty genes would thus better survive times of food scarcity .
however in modern societies with constant abundance of food this genotype efficiently prepares individuals for famine that never comes .
the result of this mismatch between the environment in which the brain evolved and the environment of today is widespread chronic obesity and related health problems like diabetes .
the hypothesis has received various criticisms and several modified or alternative hypotheses have been proposed the thrifty phenotype hypothesis arose from challenges posed to the thrifty gene hypothesis .
the thrifty phenotype hypothesis theorizes that instead of arising genetically the thrifty factors developed as direct result of the environment within the womb during development .
the development of insulin resistance is theorized to be directly related to the body predicting life of starvation for the developing fetus .
hence one of the main causes of type diabetes has been attributed to poor fetal and infant growth and the subsequent development of the metabolic syndrome .
since the hypothesis was proposed many studies world wide have confirmed the initial epidemiological evidence .
although the relationship with insulin resistance is clear at all ages studied the relation of insulin secretion is less clear .
the relative contribution of genes and environment to these relationships remains matter of debate .
other relevant observations arose from metabolism researchers who note that for practically every other species on earth fat metabolism is well regulated and that most wild animals are in fact very lean and that they remain lean even when adequate food is supplied .
many attempts have been made to search for one or more genes contributing to thrift .
modern tools of genome wide association studies have revealed many genes with small effects associated with obesity or type diabetes but all of them together explain only between and of population variance .
this leaves large gap between the pregenomic and emerging genomic estimates of heritability of obesity and type diabetes sometimes called the missing heritability .
we are yet to understand the reasons for this discrepancy .
donations to support this channel can be made here causing even increase in insulin release from the pancreas .
so number one what will cause an overstimulation of insulin is excessive amounts of carbohydrates .
secondly proteins in the absence of glucose could also cause small increases in insulin secretion .
another thing to note is that if you add carbohydrates with amino acids your insulin secretion would otherwise be doubled .
what this means is burgers with fries pancakes with eggs chicken with pasta all these combinations will double your insulin secretion .
the third thing affecting insulin secretion are gastrointestinal hormones that are triggered when we eat .
what this means is that whenever you eat regardless of what it is insulin will be secreted to some degree .
there other hormones part of the autonomic nervous system such as cortisol which upon getting released will trigger insulin secretion .
what causes cortisol release excessive stress .
given these points as whole nowhere did say fat effects insulin to large degree .
this leads into what would recommend for others and myself if had diabetes which is to eat low carb high fat diet .
this means keeping your carbohydrate intake somewhere around grams day depending on an individuals severity .
overtime when the pancreas get break and everything begins to stay within equilibrium then an individual can start to incorporate more carbohydrates .
something want to mention though is that if you don suffer from diabetes and you don have any genetic predispositions for it you don really have to worry much about your carbohydrate intake per day .
people with insulin resistance or diabetes need to worry about it because their hypersensitive .
now this doesn mean eat whatever you want because over consumption food especially processed and refined foods will predispose you to insulin resistance .
so with all this being said feel comfortable now making food recommendations .

dangerous trend since diabetes is linked to multitude of health issues and its complications can be deadly .
it can cause multi symptom organ failure including blindness in the eye heart disease .
it increases your risk of heart attack kidney disease it increases your risk of going on dialysis or having kidney failure .
you can have low circulation because the high sugar attacks every organ in the body saysdraldith lewis an internal medicine physician with lee memorial health system .
despite the sobering statistics there is hope .
research has shown that even with modest weight loss and regular exercise and when say modest weight loss its to percent of your body weight you could reduce your risk of developing diabetes by percent says krispinsky .
so when it comes to lowering the rate of diabetes the best medicine might be education .

hi and welcome .
ll be speaking today about diabetic ketoacidosis or dka .
my name is michael agus .
am pediatric intensive care doctor and pediatric endocrinologist at boston children hospital .
the director of the medicine critical care program here at children and an assistant professor at harvard medical school .
ll start by explaining how one gets diabetes to begin with because it surprise to many that diabetes really occurs develops over period of many many months .
when endocrinologists in boston set up the diabetes prevention trial or dpt several years ago although we weren able to stop the onset of diabetes we were able to track people getting diabetes .
and the way we chose the most likely people to get diabetes were to look at first degree relatives of patients with diabetes .
we know that patients who are about to get diabetes have genetic predisposition and then they have some environmental component that occurs at some point in their life .
we don understand what that environmental component is but we understand that if you have that genetic predisposition you are at risk to be affected by the environmental exposure .
when trying to identify patients at increased risk those first degree relatives so siblings parents children instead of having the usual background rate in the north american population for example of roughly of type diabetes people who have first degree relative with diabetes are at tenfold increased risk and now have incidence of type diabetes .
so you went from in to in by following these people who are at increased risk of getting diabetes we can understand that they begin to lose beta cell function months and months and months prior to the onset of clinical symptoms of diabetes .
so if we were going to take an example of child who is developing diabetes we could look at this particular graph .
and you see that even though she didn know she was on her way to get diabetes she been losing beta cell function beta cell mass from autoimmune destruction over period of many months .
when she at the point that you see here there no symptoms whatsoever .
she has enough insulin to cover the meals cover her basal production .
when she moves to the next step she has intermittent hyperglycemia .
that refers to the fact that when she has large carbohydrate load an ice cream sundae for example blood sugar may go up into the she may get little flush .
she may have increased urine output because her glucose has exceeded the renal threshold of milligrams per deciliter .
but she ll have an extra cup of water may be be little bit thirsty and come right back down into the mid to low after that .

sometimes little surprised by the answers get .
after all it seems to me asking very simple question .
what kind of diabetes do you have there are people that will know but surprising number don .
it not that they are stupid or uneducated .
it is that no one ever sat down and told them about their diabetes .
there are two main types of diabetes in those who aren pregnant .
they are simply called type and type ii diabetes .
while the end result is the same how they are obtained is very different .
type diabetes is an autoimmune disorder .
it is characterized by the blood sugars in the body being higher than normal .
this is due to an absence of insulin hormone that is produced in the pancreas .
insulin is responsible for pushing sugars that are in the bloodstream into the cell for proper use .
this hormone is deficient because the beta cells of the pancreas which are responsible for insulin production are destroyed by auto antibodies .
these are antibodies that are made by the body but actually cause destruction and do not serve to enhance the immune system .
type diabetes is disease of the young .
it peaks around years of age .
it is rare with an incidence in those at years of about per people .
non hispanic white youth have the highest incidence and african americans have the lowest incidence .
about children are diagnosed with it every year .
it usually presents either around age to or around age to and is more common in males .
there is some genetic predisposition to it but that is still being worked out .
it is thought that infectious agents like virus cause confusion to the immune system leading to these aberrant antibodies .
type diabetes has to be treated with insulin .
this makes sense as the problem is simply lack of insulin in the body .
therefore immediate insulin injections are needed although now there are apparatuses where insulin can be pumped into the body in selected individuals .
diabetes mellitus type ii is metabolic disorder that leads to high blood sugars .
however in type ii diabetes it is due to the resistance of body tissues to the action of insulin .
in most cases there is actually an overproduction of insulin but the insulin doesn seem to work very well .
type ii diabetes is brought on by obesity and sedentary lifestyle in many cases .
over of diabetics are type ii diabetics .
there about million cases united states and approximately of the population over the age of have it .
almost million new cases of this type of diabetes were diagnosed in type ii diabetes is very rare under the age of and it actually afflicts more women than men .
there is genetic tendency for it but only if obesity and sedentary lifestyle accompany those genes .
type ii diabetes mellitus can be treated with variety of different medication before having to go to insulin in selected cases .
oral medicationcan either further increase production of insulin or make the internal organs more sensitive to insulin .
however for some patients only getting massive doses of insulin to overcome the resistanceof the body organs to insulin can help properly treat type ii diabetes .
please see the other sections on how to treat diabetes .
pray for those who are afflicted with this terrible disease .

transcript study published in the lancet leading international medical journal in august found that the risk of developing diabetes is increasingly rapidly among americans .
the study also found that this risk depends on your race your education and where you live and that diabetics are living longer .
this study is the first in more than decade to calculate the risk americans face of developing diabetes during their life time .
it was conducted by epidemiologists at the us centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta georgia who have been tracking and analysing the prevalence of diabetes and the rate at which news cases are diagnosed for many years .
these researchers used mortality data for almost persons from to years to assess the risk of developing type or type diabetes excluding gestational diabetes .
though the study only examined diabetes in the context of american people it is likely that similar results would have been obtained had the study been conducted using european data or data from other countries where western type diet and life style is the norm .
the ever increasing risk of diabetes the study revealed that there was dramatic rise between and in the overall risk that an american will develop diabetes .
in american boys had percent chance of developing diabetes and girls percent .
by however that risk had jumped to percent for both boys and girls .
in other words the risk for boys had almost doubled while the risk for girls had gone up percent .
the lancet study did not analyse why this is so .
but part of the reason could be the fact that people are living longer so that they have more years during which they can develop diabetes .
diabetics are living longer the good news is that america children diagnosed with diabetes can now expect to live more than years with the disease .
indeed between and the number of years for which men diagnosed with diabetes can expect to survive increased by percent .
for women the figure was percent .
though no explanation was given by the researchers this is probably due to advances in medical knowledge and treatments over the last years .
being diabetic shortens your life span .
over the year period examined by the researchers the average number of years lost due to diabetes for the population as whole increased by percent in men and percent in women .
this is obviously due to the increasing prevalence of diabetes .
it may also be partly due to the fact that there are probably fewer undiagnosed cases nowadays .
while the picture for the population as whole seems to be getting bleaker things are improving for the individual diabetic .
the number of years of his life man diagnosed with diabetes can expect to lose on average decreased by almost two years from to lost years between the and the end of the women also gained an average of two years their losses decreasing from to years over the same time span .
these improvements are probably due to better treatment regimes .
race gender and diabetes while americans overall have gloomy percent chance of developing diabetes the outlook for blacks and hispanics is much grimmer .
white boys have and white girls risk of developing diabetes .
by contrast the chances for black men are while for their sisters the risk is whopping .
the chances of developing diabetes for hispanic boys and girls are and respectively .
these figures which refer to the risks of developing diabetes reinforce the idea that diabetes has genetic origin at least to the extent that your genes can predispose you to diabetes .
most medical researchers agree that it your life style that kicks it into action .
according to the researchers they analysed race because that was the data they had available but they did state that socio economic status is probably as important as if not more important than race .
nevertheless the risk of developing diabetes for whites is much less than it is for blacks and hispanics .
indeed the risk for white girls is third less than the risk for black and hispanic ladies .
as you can see hispanics of both sexes as well as black women have risk that exceeds percent .
but why black men have risk that is almost percentage points less than black women cannot be explained away by genetic differences .
education and diabetes the less educated you are the greater your risk of developing diabetes .
according to the lancet in the number of new diagnoses among high school drop outs was per thousand while among high school graduates it was and for those who studied beyond high school per thousand .
this figure for the number of new diagnoses of diabetes among high school drop outs high school graduates and those who continued to study after hi .

designing new drugs would be easier if scientists understood the biology of the diseases they are trying to treat but for most common diseases which are caused by many different genes and environmental factors acting in concert gaining that understanding has been challenge .
in recent years however by studying the genomes of hundreds of thousands of people scientists have uncovered hundreds of genetic factors that influence disease risk including some genomic regions containing variants that either make people more prone to type diabetes or protect them from it .
many of the findings are upending what scientists thought they knew about the disease .
david altshuler will discuss how these discoveries can be translated into biological insights and inspiration for new treatments .

diabetes refers to group of conditions characterized by high level of blood glucose commonly referred to as blood sugar .
too much sugar in the blood can cause serious sometimes life threatening health problems .
there are two types of chronic diabetic conditions type diabetes and type diabetes .
pregnant women may acquire transient form of the disease called gestational diabetes which usually resolves after the birth of baby .
pre diabetes is when the blood sugar level is at the borderline higher than normal but lower than in diabetics .
prediabetes may or may not progress to diabetes .
during food digestion carbohydrates or carb break down into glucose which is carried by the bloodstream to various organs of the body .
here it is either consumed as an energy source in muscles for example or is stored for later use in the liver .
insulin is hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas and is necessary for glucose intake by target cells .
in other words when insulin is deficient muscle or liver cells are unable to use or store glucose and as result glucose accumulates in the blood .
in healthy people beta cells of the pancreas produce insulin insulin binds to its receptor on target cells and induces glucose intake .
in type diabetes beta cells of the pancreas are destroyed by the immune system by mistake .
the reason why this happens is unclear but genetic factors are believed to play major role .
insulin production is reduced less insulin binds to its receptor on target cells less glucose is taken into the cells more glucose stays in the blood .
type is characterized by early onset symptoms commonly start suddenly and before the age of type diabetes is normally managed with insulin injection .
type diabetics are therefore insulin dependent .
in type diabetes the pancreas produces enough insulin but something goes wrong either with receptor binding or insulin signaling inside the target cells .
the cells are not responsive to insulin and therefore cannot import glucose glucose stays in the blood .
in other words type diabetics are insulin resistant .
here again genetic factors predispose susceptibility to the disease but it is believed that lifestyle plays very important role in type typically obesity inactive lifestyle and unhealthy diet are associated with higher risk of type diabetes .
type is characterized by adult onset symptoms usually appear gradually and start after the age of type diabetes accounts for about to of all diabetics .
management focuses on weight loss and includes low carb diet .

see how insulin and glucagon control blood sugar levels .
the glucagon hormone helps prevent low blood sugar levels and helps keep energy levels balanced .
when say low blood sugar levels this is typically lifestyle related caused by people who follow low calorie diets skip meals and do excessive cardio .
similar to the leptin hormone glucagon is also considered hormone that can turn off hunger as the secretion of glucagon can reduce the production of the hunger hormone ghrelin and signal to the body the feeling of being full .

in this video certified diabetes educator from mayo clinic explains the equipment and process for using glucagon for people with diabetes .
severe hypoglycemia or low blood sugar can be very serious and can caused when insulin and blood glucose are out of balance .
contributing factors can be too much insulin not eating enough food too much exercise or eating late .
for cases of severe hypoglycemia school nurses and trained staff may administer glucagon .
glucagon an important incretin plays big role in regulation of blood sugar and ketosis .
learn how by watching this video and learn more by following my blog at docmuscles com .
mrs foy explains how the hormones insulin and glucagon keep blood glucose levels in homeostasis .
in this lesson you will learn about how your blood glucose level is regulated or controlled by two important hormones insulin and glucagon via negative feedback system .
when you consume meal that is high in carbohydrates such as rice pasta and bread this will cause your blood glucose level to increase .
carbohydrates are essentially long chains of repeating glucose monomer units much like beads on necklace .
during digestion this is broken apart into glucose which absorbed into our bloodstream .
this increased blood glucose level causes gland known as the pancreas to secrete hormone called insulin .
remember that gland secretes hormones which act on specific target organs .
in this case the target organ is your liver which is stimulated to convert glucose to glycogen .
glycogen is basically long multi branched chains of glucose monomers stored in liver and muscle cells .
insulin also causes your body cells to uptake or take in glucose .
so this decreases your blood glucose level back to its optimal state .
when this system is faulty this leads to medical condition known as diabetes if you want to learn more about diabetes this will be addressed in another video .
the same response also occurs when you consume foods and drinks high in sugar such as sweets cakes and fizzy drinks .
when your blood glucose level drops such as when you are hungry the pancreas secretes hormone called glucagon .
like insulin the target organ for glucagon is also the liver though it stimulates the opposite process the breakdown of glycogen into glucose .
this increases your blood glucose level back to its optimal state .
so to review insulin and glucagon are two hormones released by the pancreas which act on the liver to regulate our blood glucose level .

the fat burning hormone glucagon it important to have basic understanding of the fat burning hormones if you re having trouble losing weight or want to drop your body fat levels .
glucagon is one of the fat and sugar releasing hormones .
it works the opposite of insulin .
look at it like this insulin is the storage hormone and glucagon is the releasing hormone .
if you want to burn fat lipolysis you want your insulin to be low and glucagon to be high .
how to increase fat burning hormone .
long walks on an empty stomach when insulin levels are low fasting low carb diet low sugar eating an optimal amount of protein short high intensity training hit these hormones produce complex reactions in the body and there are many text books written about them .
to keep things simple however just look at insulin vs glucagon .
there is constant balancing act between the two hormones .
just keep your insulin levels low by limiting your sugary carbohydrates not eating too many meals in one day and staying active .
short high intensity training hit is also good for increasing glucagon .

in this video we discuss the hormone glucagon and its function to act upon the liver to stimulate glycogenolysis and increase blood glucose levels .
correction referred to cck and secretin as glucagon stimulators but they are actually glucagon inhibitors due to being released during the fed state .
cck and secretin are insulin stimulators as their action is to lower blood glucose levels .

all glp receptor agonists share common mechanism activation of the glp receptor .
glp receptors are expressed by cells cells in the peripheral and central nervous systems the heart and vasculature kidney lung and gi mucosa .
binding of agonists to the glp receptor activates the cyclic amp pka pathway and several gefs guanine nucleotide exchange factors .
glp receptor activation also initiates signaling via pkc and pi and alters the activity of several ion channels .
in cells the end result of these actions is increased insulin biosynthesis and exocytosis in glucose dependent manner .
the treatment of diabetes is advancing rapidly .
one of the most important drugs nowadays are those working on the glp system if you are studying pharmacology or internal medicine endocrinology this video will be of great help .

victoza liraglutide is glucagon like peptide glp receptor agonist indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type diabetes mellitus to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease .
liraglutide is an analog of human glp and acts as glp receptor agonist .
the peptide precursor of liraglutide produced by process that includes expression of recombinant dna in saccharomyces cerevisiae has been engineered to be homologous to native human glp by substituting arginine for lysine at position liraglutide is made by attaching fatty acid palmitic acid with glutamic acid spacer on the remaining lysine residue at position of the peptide precursor .
liraglutide is an acylated human glp receptor agonist with amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human glp .
glp represents less than of total circulating endogenous glp like glp liraglutide activates the glp receptor membrane bound cell surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase by the stimulatory protein gs in pancreatic beta cells .
liraglutide increases intracellular cyclic amp camp leading to insulin release in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations .
this insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia .
liraglutide also decreases glucagon secretion in glucose dependent manner .
the mechanism of blood glucose lowering also involves delay in gastric emptying .

trulicity dulaglutide is glucagon like peptide glp receptor agonist indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type diabetes mellitus .
trulicity contains dulaglutide which is human glp receptor agonist with amino acid sequence homology to endogenous human glp .
dulaglutide activates the glp receptor membrane bound cell surface receptor coupled to adenylyl cyclase in pancreatic beta cells .
dulaglutide increases intracellular cyclic amp camp in beta cells leading to glucose dependent insulin release .
dulaglutide also decreases glucagon secretion and slows gastric emptying .
researchers at the university of cincinnati have discovered shot of medication used with weight loss surgery could make big difference in the results .
local liz bonis shares the details in today medical edge .
many people struggling with weight loss turn to surgery similar to the one doctors are performing here .
it called gastric banding .
band is placed around the gut to shrink the size of the stomach .
governor chris christie of new jersey just had this type of surgery .
he said it was to avoid gastric bypass major surgery which re routes the intestines .
the down side .
the gastric band is less effective than the roux en gastric bypass .
or at least is was until now .
kirk habegger is an obesity researcher who had theory about why this was true .
so every theory starts with hypothesis what started yours .
one of the key hormones that is changed during the bypass surgery the more invasive version is one that is hormone called glucagon like peptide one and it actually been utilized as therapeutic most people know it as byetta .
that right .
he recently found that this hormone known as glp one in the injectible drug for diabetes known as byetta can even out the results of these two surgeries .
in lab studies he found glp one with gastric banding enhances weight loss .
the hormone appears to help alter appetite .
so it sounds like in the end what you ve developed is still the result of eating less food .
it definitely suppresses the drive to eat .
the goal now is see if further studies show those who have this surgery can lose more weight with two therapies instead of one .
by combining the fda approved drug that we already have with the procedure that we already use hopefully we can have combination therapy that is just as effective and less invasive .
byetta does have side effects so right now further studies do need to be conducted to see what happens when this medication is used for long period of time with this weight loss surgery not just in lab studies but in people too .

in this video discuss what is glucose the main functions of glucose in the body .
transcript what is glucose .
well glucose is molecule and it is known as monosaccharide which is the most basic unit of carbohydrate .
it is the key source of energy for all cells and organs in our bodies .
foods high in glucose include fruits veggies and grains .
desserts and candy contain lot of glucose as well .
many sweets have lot of added sugar in them and sugar is made up of glucose and fructose .
as mentioned before glucose is major source of energy in our bodies .
glucose is absorbed into the bloodstream rather quickly so it can provide quick energy to cells .
extra glucose can get stored as glycogen in the liver or muscles providing an energy reserve .
as with most substances in the body too much glucose can cause problems .
over consuming any type of food including foods with high glucose content can lead to obesity which in turn can lead to an increased risk of many diseases such as diabetes cardiovascular disease high blood pressure and even respiratory problems .

at one point it was which test was used as to what the condition was called .
what you call something is kind of interesting isn it .
did you know it is now politically incorrect to call someone with diabetes diabetic .
now diabetic medications and diabetic foods are fine .
but many people who have diabetes actively resist being labeled as diabetic as if we were an illness .
correspondent writes what give as an example to doctors and other technical people is if person has hemorrhoids does that make that person one now personally am not offended one bit by the term diabetic if someone refers to me as that .
but have tried to be very careful in my video series to not use that term when describing people because it does offend some people and that just isn something want to do .
but terms in the world of diabetes have been developing and changing over the years .
here are some examples what used to be called juvenile diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes mellitus iddm is now referred to as type diabetes .
the former terms adult onset diabetes or non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus niddm are now called type diabetes .
and there is no such thing as borderline diabetes .
if that what you think you have it is either pre diabetes or diabetes .
so what was once called impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose is now pre diabetes or prediabetes .
there is even some controversy over there should be hyphen the reason given for this change was to show the seriousness of the condition .
the latest have found to be argued in the diabetes community is to change the name of prediabetes to stage type diabetes .
as many of you know many doctors and even insurance companies don recognize prediabetes as diabetes proper .
the movement to change the name to stage type diabetes is starting to gain ground .
this is one movement think could support .
it gives those with prediabetes more concrete idea of what they truly have .
but it also gives sense that just because they have prediabetes it will definitely become type which isn true .
names can change total outlook on things .
but rather than argue over the name of what you have it is much more important to work on your diet and exercise plan to control that blood sugar or blood glucose .
yes there are people who want to argue that as well .
bg or bs .
probably little bit of both in those arguments .

at present the only completed module is one concerning the conduct and interpretation of the glucose tolerance test gtt .
in gtt glucose is adminstered to the patient in order to determine how quickly it is cleared from the blood .
the test is usually used to test for diabetes insulin resistance and sometimes reactive hypoglycemia .
the glucose is most often given orally so the common test is technically an oral glucose tolerance test ogtt .

all pregnant women should be screened for gestational diabetes around weeks gestation .
and it important to test for this because if woman has gestational diabetes or if she had previously diagnosed type or type diabetes if uncontrolled it can cause complications like preeclampsia blood sugar problems for the baby after delivery stillbirth and an abnormally large baby which has complications associated with that too .
to of women develop gestational diabetes and it all goes back to insulin resistance .
insulin is the key that unlocks your body cells so that sugar can go inside and make the cells work .
and your body naturally becomes little more insulin resistant during pregnancy so that there enough sugar circulating in your blood so the baby gets what it needs .
normally mothers can compensate for this by producing more insulin but mothers who have gestational diabetes aren able to make more insulin and so blood sugar levels rise .
so testing like said for this is done are weeks and what will happen is the doctor will have you drink very sugary drink .
it contains grams of glucose .
and then they ll test your blood sugar an hour later and see how your body responded .
if you get value of to then you may have gestational diabetes and the doctor will want to do follow up test .
if the value you get on your first test is or higher then you just have gestational diabetes but they may still want to do follow up testing .
and in both cases it doing hour glucose tolerance test .
this is done when you re fasting and then you drink double the amount of sugar .
it gram glucose sugar drink .
and then they test your blood sugar every hour for hours and see what it is .
and then based on those values they determine if you truly have gestational diabetes or not .
if the diagnosis is made then there couple of different ways to manage it .
and it super important to keep your blood sugars under control so that you don have the complications discussed before .
the management plan is going to be dependent on how severe your case is .
and for lot of women it just involves some diet changes and exercise .
for other women it involves taking oral medication .
and for about of women with gestational diabetes it has to be controlled with insulin .
and you may start out just needing to make few diet changes and then as the pregnancy progresses so do your body needs and so do your baby needs and so that may change the plan as well .
so you could start out being diet controlled and then you may end up with oral medication or with insulin .
so this speaks of the importance of consistent monitoring .
diabetic educator will meet with you and talk to you about your treatment plan and also tell you how often you should be monitoring your blood sugars .
they ll take peek at your values each week and based on that determine if additional changes in your treatment plan are necessary .
