ways your body tries to tell you that your <MT>liver</MT> is being damaged the <MT>liver</MT> is the largest solid <MT>organ</MT> in your body
it is located in the right upper quadrant of your <MT>abdomen</MT> and partly protected by the <MT>ribs</MT>
you need your <MT>liver</MT> for many important bodily functions and cannot live without your <MT>liver</MT>
for this reason you should know the early signs of <MT>liver damage</MT> and take care of your <MT>liver</MT>
there are more than hundred different kinds of <MT>diseases of the liver</MT>
each has its own set of symptoms
some of these <MT>diseases</MT> include <MT>alcoholic liver</MT> <MT>disease hepatitis fatty</MT> <MT>liver disease</MT> and <MT>cirrhosis of the liver</MT>
the early signs of <MT>liver disease</MT> tend to be easily overlooked and are non specific related to any number of different conditions
here are some common early signs
<MT>upset stomach</MT> you are likely to get <MT>nausea</MT> and <MT>vomiting</MT>
they can mimic other diseases such as <MT>migraines</MT> <MT>food poisoning</MT> <MT>vertigo</MT> <MT>motion sickness</MT> <MT>early pregnancy depression</MT> and <MT>vomiting</MT>
it can mimic <MT>kidney</MT> problems
those who suffer from <MT>early liver damage</MT> often feel persistently <MT>nauseous</MT> because the <MT>liver</MT> has decreased ability to rid the body of <MT>toxins</MT>
the <MT>nausea</MT> can also be due to ongoing <MT>metabolism</MT> and changes in digestion
if you have these symptoms for several days and don know why seek the attention of your doctor
fatigue and overall weakness one of the early and obvious signs of <MT>liver damage</MT> is constantly feeling tired and weak
when the <MT>liver</MT> is not in great condition the body
this is due to an increase in <MT>toxins</MT> in the <MT>bloodstream</MT> that can be cleared out because the <MT>liver</MT> can get rid of the <MT>toxins</MT>
if the symptoms persist especially with other early signs of <MT>liver damage</MT> seek medical advice
<MT>lack of appetite</MT> this happens due to lack of production of <MT>bile</MT> that helps digest <MT>fat</MT> in the diet
when food isn properly digested it can lead to <MT>lack of appetite</MT> and severe <MT>loss of weight</MT>
see your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms
digestion problems the <MT>liver</MT> is important in digestion because it makes <MT>bile</MT> that helps the nutrients be better processed and absorbed by the <MT>small intestines</MT>
if the <MT>liver</MT> is failing you can develop an increase in <MT>indigestion</MT> and <MT>diarrhea</MT>
if the <MT>bile</MT> is not produced properly you can also experience <MT>irritable bowel syndrome</MT> <MT>fatty food intolerance</MT> <MT>alcohol intolerance</MT> <MT>abdominal bloating constipation</MT> and <MT>gallstones</MT>
if this becomes severe you need to seek the medical attention of doctor
alterations in the color of <MT>urine</MT> if you think you are drinking enough but still have dark color of your <MT>urine</MT> this may be one of the early signs of <MT>liver damage</MT>
the <MT>urine</MT> may look brown amber or orange in color because of elevated <MT>levels of bilirubin</MT> in the <MT>bloodstream</MT>
the <MT>bilirubin</MT> is elevated because the <MT>liver</MT> cannot get rid of the <MT>bilirubin</MT> and it is excreted through the <MT>kidneys</MT>
<MT>dark urine</MT> may also be due to <MT>dehydration</MT> side effects of taking <MT>antibiotics</MT> taking <MT>vitamin supplements</MT> <MT>urinary tract infections</MT> <MT>enzyme deficiencies</MT> or <MT>kidney abnormalities</MT>
the doctor can help sort out the cause of <MT>dark urine</MT>
changes in <MT>stool</MT> coloration because the <MT>bile</MT> is not made enough by <MT>malfunctioning liver</MT>
instead of being brown it can become pale yellow clay colored or gray in appearance
if this happens periodically it is not dangerous but if it happens often seek the advice of your doctor to check out your <MT>liver</MT>
<MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is probably the most serious medical condition
so what is <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> why is it so serious and why haven you heard
here is what you need to know
the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is cluster of the most dangerous <MT>heart attack</MT> risk factors <MT>raised blood glucose central adiposity</MT> often called beer belly abnormal <MT>cholesterol levels</MT> abnormal <MT>blood fats</MT> also called <MT>triglycerides</MT> and <MT>high blood pressure</MT>
it is estimated that in adults have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and the condition becomes more common as we get older so that by the age of nearly third of adults have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
so why is <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
well if you have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> you are much more likely to suffer <MT>heart attack</MT> or stroke more likely to develop full blown <MT>diabetes</MT> more likely to develop cancer and more likely to develop <MT>alzheimer disease</MT>
all of these conditions
<MT>dementia</MT> and <MT>alzheimer disease</MT> have overtaken cancer and <MT>heart disease</MT> as the leading cause of death in england and wales in and the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and <MT>diabetes</MT>
so how can you check to see if you have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
well first of all get out tape measure
if you are man and your waist circumference is more than cm or if you are woman and your waist is more than cm you have one of the main features of <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
if in addition you have any of the following you will be classified as having <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> <MT>raised blood triglycerides</MT> <MT>reduced hdl cholesterol</MT> sometimes known as good <MT>cholesterol</MT> <MT>raised blood pressure</MT> or <MT>raised fasting plasma glucose</MT>
note if you are man of south asian or indian heritage the important threshold for waist circumference is cm
<MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> has not yet been classified as <MT>disease</MT> it is still regarded as collection of signs and symptoms which together are serious risk factors for our most deadly and disabling medical conditions
several medical organisations such as the world health organisation who the independent <MT>diabetes</MT> federation idf and the european group for the study of <MT>insulin resistance</MT> egir define the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> in very slightly different ways and this adds even more to the confusion about what exactly <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
however many experts now believe that the underlying problem in <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
<MT>insulin resistance</MT> develops when this <MT>hormone</MT> cannot work properly when <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> are abnormally high and still relatively ineffective in keeping <MT>blood glucose levels</MT>
metabolic specialists now use the term <MT>insulin resistance syndrome</MT> instead of <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
<MT>insulin</MT> is <MT>hormone</MT> produced by the <MT>pancreas</MT> and it is important in the <MT>metabolism</MT> of <MT>carbohydrates</MT> and <MT>fats</MT>
when sugar and <MT>carbohydrates</MT> are eaten <MT>insulin</MT> promotes the uptake of <MT>glucose</MT> from the <MT>blood</MT> into <MT>muscles</MT> and <MT>fat cells</MT>
hence it is often said that <MT>insulin</MT> allows cells to use <MT>glucose</MT> for energy and also to store excess <MT>glucose</MT> and sugar as <MT>glycogen</MT> and <MT>fat</MT>
when <MT>blood glucose levels</MT> fall stored <MT>glucose</MT> is released for energy from the breakdown of <MT>glycogen</MT> stores in the <MT>liver</MT> and in the <MT>muscles</MT>
in the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> <MT>insulin levels</MT>
fasting <MT>blood levels of insulin</MT> in the morning are often abnormally high and <MT>insulin levels</MT> rise to very high levels when food is eaten
continuously high <MT>levels of insulin</MT> cause the <MT>liver cells</MT> to store <MT>fat</MT> resulting in <MT>fatty liver</MT>
as the <MT>insulin resistance</MT> worsens the <MT>pancreas</MT> may not be able to produce enough <MT>insulin</MT> in response to food and then <MT>glucose levels in the blood</MT> rise above the threshold for the patient to be called <MT>diabetic</MT>
so why haven you heard of <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
well until quite recently the connection between <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and host of <MT>chronic diseases</MT>
we now know that <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
until recently it was difficult to measure <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> but the technology has improved and we can now measure <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> accurately and we have good tests to diagnose <MT>insulin resistance</MT> as well as good strategies to reverse <MT>insulin resistance</MT> and the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
once you can measure <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
also get our <MT>diabetes</MT> management guide here this is great question because sometimes the term <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> also called <MT>syndrome</MT> is used when discussing <MT>pre diabetes</MT>
but the are not the same thing
according to the mayo clinic <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is cluster of conditions <MT>increased blood pressure</MT> <MT>high blood sugar</MT> excess <MT>body fat</MT> around the waist and <MT>abnormal cholesterol</MT> or <MT>triglyceride levels</MT> that occur together increasing your risk of <MT>heart disease</MT> stroke and <MT>diabetes</MT>
having just one of these conditions doesn mean you have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
however any of these conditions increase your risk of serious <MT>disease</MT>
having more than one of these might increase your risk even more
an underlying cause of <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is <MT>insulin resistance</MT> condition that increases the chances of developing <MT>pre diabetes</MT> type <MT>diabetes</MT> and <MT>cardiovascular disease</MT>
so an understanding of the interaction of <MT>insulin resistance</MT> <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and <MT>pre diabetes</MT> is critical to making lifestyle changes that can help you avoid type <MT>diabetes</MT>
food is broken down in the body into <MT>glucose</MT> the <MT>simple sugar</MT>
it is digested into many different <MT>macromolecules protein fat</MT> and <MT>carbohydrates</MT>
then <MT>carbohydrates</MT> are broken down further into <MT>glucose</MT> which is the simple energy used by cells
<MT>insulin</MT> allows this <MT>glucose</MT> to leave the <MT>blood stream</MT> and enter the cell where it can fuel the activities of that cell
your <MT>pancreas</MT> makes and secretes <MT>insulin</MT>
but <MT>glucose</MT> can enter the cells if your <MT>pancreas</MT> doesn manufacture enough <MT>insulin</MT> or your cells are unable to process the <MT>insulin</MT> that is present in the <MT>blood stream</MT>
as result <MT>glucose levels</MT> become elevated setting the stage for <MT>pre diabetes</MT>
<MT>tissues</MT> with too much <MT>fat</MT> produce fewer <MT>insulin receptors</MT> and are more resistant to <MT>insulin</MT>
in vicious cycle the <MT>pancreas</MT> responds by pumping more <MT>insulin</MT> until the <MT>insulin producing cells</MT> die from exhaustion
type <MT>diabetes</MT>
when you are <MT>insulin resistant</MT> your <MT>muscle fat</MT> and <MT>liver cells</MT> do not use <MT>insulin</MT>
the <MT>pancreas</MT> tries to keep up with the demand for <MT>insulin</MT>
eventually the <MT>pancreas</MT> cannot keep up with the body need for <MT>insulin</MT> causing excess <MT>glucose</MT> to build up in the <MT> blood stream</MT>
many people with <MT>insulin resistance</MT> have high levels of both <MT>blood glucose</MT> and <MT>insulin</MT>
<MT>pre diabetes</MT> means you have higher risk of developing type <MT>diabetes</MT>
studies have shown that most people with <MT>pre diabetes</MT> go on to develop <MT>type ii diabetes</MT> within years unless they make changes to their weight their diet and their levels of physical activity
while both <MT>diabetes</MT> <MT>pre diabetes</MT> and <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> have <MT>insulin resistance</MT>

link to the study <MT>acetyl carnitine</MT> to the <MT>brain</MT> <MT>carnitine</MT> acts as reservoir of <MT>long chain fatty acids</MT> for incorporation into <MT>red blood cell membrane phospholipids</MT> during repair after oxidative insults it is also used in the synthesis of <MT>dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine</MT> the major component of <MT>surfactant</MT> in <MT>lung</MT>
<MT>carnitine</MT> can be used therapeutically to stimulate <MT>gastric</MT> and <MT>pancreatic secretions</MT> and in the treatment of <MT>hyperlipoproteinemias</MT>
these nutrients are all required for <MT>carnitine</MT> synthesis <MT>magnesium vitamin iron vitamins</MT> and and <MT>alpha ketoglutarate</MT> along with the cofactors responsible for creating same <MT>methionine</MT> <MT>folic acid vitamin</MT> and <MT>betaine</MT> <MT>carnitine</MT> supplementation has improved some patients who have <MT>angina</MT> secondary to <MT>coronary artery disease</MT>
<MT>carnitine</MT> supplements may be useful in many forms of <MT>toxic</MT> or <MT>metabolic liver disease</MT> and in cases of <MT>heart muscle disease</MT>
hearts undergoing severe <MT>arrhythmia</MT> quickly deplete their stores of <MT>carnitine</MT>
athletes particularly in europe have used <MT>carnitine</MT>
<MT>carnitine</MT> may improve <MT>muscle building</MT> by improving <MT>fat</MT> utilization and may even be useful in treating <MT>obesity</MT>
<MT>carnitine</MT> may be of value in treating pregnant women <MT>hypothyroid</MT> individuals and <MT>male infertility</MT>
even the physician desk reference gives indication for <MT>carnitine</MT> supplements as improving the tolerance of <MT>ischemic heart disease</MT> <MT>myocardial</MT> insufficiencies and <MT>type iv hyperlipoproteinemia</MT>
<MT>carnitine deficiency</MT> is noted in abnormal <MT>liver</MT> function <MT>renal dialysis</MT> patients and severe to moderate <MT>muscular weakness</MT> with associated <MT>anorexia</MT> patients with <MT>chronic fatigue syndrome</MT> <MT>cfs</MT> were found to have low free <MT>carnitine</MT> total <MT>carnitine</MT> and <MT>acylcarnitine</MT> compared to controls <MT>carnitine</MT> is <MT>peripheral antagonist of thyroid</MT>
it inhibits <MT>thyroid hormone</MT>
in <MT>controlled clinical trial carnitine</MT> was shown to reverse or prevent some <MT>symptoms of hyperthyroidism</MT>
conditions associated with <MT>carnitine deficiency</MT> include cancer <MT>diabetes</MT> <MT>alzheimer disease</MT> and <MT>heart failure</MT>
deficienies may result in accumulation of <MT>fat</MT> within <MT>skeletal muscle</MT> <MT>cardiac muscle</MT> and <MT>liver</MT> disruption of <MT>muscle fibers</MT> and an accumulation of large aggregates of <MT>mitochondria</MT> within <MT>skeletal</MT>
deficiency can result in <MT>cardiomyopathy</MT> congestive  <MT>heart failure</MT> <MT>encephalopathy hepatomegaly</MT> impaired growth and development in infants and <MT>neuromuscular disorders</MT>
primary <MT>carnitine deficiency</MT> has symptoms such as <MT>muscle fatigue cramps</MT> and <MT>myoglobinemia</MT> following exercise
additional <MT>symptoms of chronic carnitine</MT> deficiency can include <MT>hypoglycemia</MT> progressive <MT>myasthenia hypotonia</MT> or <MT>lethargy</MT>
<MT>secondary carnitine deficiency</MT> is not as rare and is most commonly associated with dialysis in chronic <MT>renal failure</MT> although it can also be induced by <MT>intestinal resection</MT> severe infection and <MT>liver disease</MT>
first study to reveal mechanism underlying abnormal <MT>fat</MT> accumulation in <MT>hiv</MT> patients boston building upon their earlier research on the <MT>biology of fat metabolism</MT> joslin scientists discovered that <MT>micrornas</MT> which are involved in the formation of mature <MT>rna</MT> and play important roles in many <MT>types of tissue</MT> play major role in the distribution and <MT>determination</MT> of <MT>fat cells</MT> and whole body <MT>metabolism</MT>
also the study is the first to reveal that <MT>micrornas mirnas</MT> influence the development of <MT>lipodystrophy</MT> abnormal <MT>fat</MT> accumulation which affects people with <MT>hiv</MT>

other indications for its deficiency include inactive reflexes <MT>abnormal heartbeat</MT> <MT>heart palpitations anemia</MT> and <MT>severe headaches</MT>
<MT>potassium</MT> deficient people may also experience <MT>high blood pressure</MT> pain in their <MT>intestines <MT>swelling</MT></MT> in their <MT>glands</MT> and <MT>diabetes</MT>
important sources of <MT>potassium</MT>
also you can get an ample amount of this mineral
apart from those nuts lime beans potatoes and poultry are other products to be included in the <MT>potassium</MT>
however the important sources of this mineral also include avocados bananas and coconut water
stabilizes <MT>blood sugar</MT> decrease in the <MT>potassium</MT> level causes drop in <MT>blood sugar</MT>
decrease in <MT>blood sugar</MT> can cause sweating <MT>headache</MT> weakness trembling and nervousness
intake of <MT>potassium</MT> <MT>chloride</MT> and <MT>sodium</MT>
this is also why diabetics are encouraged to keep their <MT>potassium</MT> levels normal to reduce the chances of unpredictable spikes and plunges in their <MT>glucose</MT> and <MT>insulin levels</MT> by stabilizing the <MT>blood sugar</MT> levels
reduces <MT>muscle disorders</MT> sufficient concentration of this mineral is required for the regular contraction
most of the <MT>potassium ions</MT> in the human body are located in the <MT>muscle cells</MT>
it maintains optimal <MT>muscle</MT> and <MT>nerve function</MT> and helps to keep our reflexes fast because it stimulates the neural connectivity of <MT>muscles</MT> and the <MT>brain</MT>
prevents cramps <MT>muscle cramps</MT> are common result of low levels of <MT>potassium</MT> in the <MT>blood condition</MT> called <MT>hypokalemia</MT>
if you consume banana every day you can easily prevent <MT>muscle cramps</MT> because bananas have rich <MT>potassium</MT>
stabilizes <MT>blood pressure</MT> <MT>potassium</MT> is helpful in reversing the role of <MT>sodium</MT>
thus it acts as vital component that maintains the normality of <MT>blood pressure</MT> in the human body
this further reduces the risk of <MT>heart diseases</MT> and <MT>ypertension</MT>
<MT>regulation of blood pressure</MT> is one of the most important functions of this powerful mineral
as mentioned earlier it has <MT>vasodilation</MT> properties that work to relieve the <MT>tension of blood vessels</MT> which is one of the main causes of <MT>high blood pressure</MT>
strengthens <MT>muscles</MT> one of the useful benefits of MT>potassium</MT> is its role in ensuring the proper growth of <MT>muscle tissues</MT> and the utilization of energy released during <MT>metabolism</MT>
the <MT>muscle</MT> including those all important <MT>cardiac muscles</MT> are prone to paralysis due to <MT>deficiency of potassium in person diet</MT>
stimulating cell growth and providing the metabolic energy to do so is vital function of <MT>potassium</MT>
also without the contraction and relaxation that <MT>potassium</MT> allows <MT>muscles</MT> to perform exercise
boosts <MT>metabolism</MT> <MT>potassium</MT> assists in the metabolic processing of various nutrients like <MT>fats</MT> and <MT>carbohydrates</MT>
thus it is of great value in extracting the energy from nutrients that are consumed
studies have shown that this mineral is also an integral part in the synthesis of protein which has an impact on <MT>tissue regeneration cell</MT> growth and an overall balanced <MT>metabolism</MT>
boosts <MT>heart</MT> health the health benefits of <MT>potassium</MT> ensure good health for the heart as well as the <MT>kidneys</MT>
it plays an irreplaceable role in regulating the functions of the <MT>metabolism</MT> and keeping the <MT>heart</MT> and <MT>kidney</MT>
additionally this mineral assists the <MT>kidney</MT> in removing waste through the <MT>process of excretion</MT>
however it is strongly advised to consult your doctor to get recommendations about <MT>potassium</MT> dosage because it can help to stimulate the body to absorb more <MT>calcium</MT> than necessary which can actually calcify and cause <MT>kidney</MT> problems

getting <MT>ketones</MT> into our nutrition the average american will never see starvation or famine the conditions that historically triggered the endogenous production of <MT>ketones</MT>
indeed more people will die worldwide this year of <MT>obesity</MT> related diseases than from hunger
virtually no citizen will experience the consecutive days of starvation or undergo the multi day fast required to trigger their <MT>ketone</MT>
until recently short of starvation the only other recognized way of including <MT>ketones</MT> in the diet was to induce the body to make them endogenously through <MT>low carbohydrate ketogenic type diet</MT> that forces <MT>glucose</MT> and <MT>insulin</MT> levels down thereby inducing the body to burn <MT>fatty acids</MT> to make <MT>ketones</MT>
this approach requires strict dietary compliance making its widespread adoption impossible given the present american diet

descriptions of <MT>thyroid</MT> pain symptoms about percent of the united states population suffers
the risk for developing <MT>hypothyroidism</MT> and <MT>infertility</MT>
if you have multiple signs and symptoms of this problem ask your doctor to check your <MT>thyroid</MT> <MT>hormone</MT> levels and get <MT>treatment of thyroid</MT>
here are the signs and symptoms that you have an <MT>underactive thyroid</MT>
unexplained weight gain weight gain without any change in diet or physical activity may indicate low levels of <MT>thyroid hormones</MT>
these <MT>hormones</MT> help regulate <MT>basal metabolism</MT> and <MT>thermogenesis</MT> as well as the <MT>metabolism of fats</MT> and <MT>glucose</MT>
an <MT>underactive thyroid</MT> contributes to lower <MT>metabolic rate</MT>
if you have unexplained weight gain it is essential to consult your doctor to determine the exact cause and get <MT>hypothyroidism</MT>
dry and flaky skin if you are following your usual beauty and skin care regimen and haven changed any of the products you use but your skin is dry and itchy it could be symptom of <MT>hypothyroidism</MT> or <MT>thyroid dry skin</MT>
the change in <MT>skin texture</MT> and appearance can be due to reduced <MT>blood circulation</MT> one of the side effects of having low <MT>thyroid hormones</MT>
in addition slowed <MT>metabolism</MT> due to low <MT>thyroid hormone</MT> production can reduce sweating
without proper sweating the skin becomes dry and flaky
as these skin
it is best to consult your doctor to see if there is an underlying health condition causing these skin changes
<MT>muscle</MT> soreness and pain people suffering from <MT>hypothyroidism</MT> often experience <MT>muscle weakness pain</MT> stiffness or cramping
there may also be <MT>general joint pain</MT>
low <MT>metabolism</MT> disrupts how your body burns energy which can affect how your <MT>muscles</MT>
low <MT>thyroid</MT> often increases <MT>inflammation</MT> that may be contributing to your <MT>muscle</MT> and <MT>joint pain</MT>
in fact about percent of the <MT>hypothyroid</MT> patients had predominantly sensory signs of <MT>sensorimotor axonal neuropathy</MT> early in the <MT>course of thyroid disease</MT>
<MT>hair losshypothyroidism</MT> hair loss and proper functioning of the <MT>thyroid gland</MT> is essential for the development and maintenance of the <MT>hair follicles</MT> and an <MT>underactive thyroid</MT>
it may also affect eyebrows and body hair
the <MT>thyroid hormones thyroxine</MT> and <MT>triiodothyronine</MT> modulate several aspects of hair <MT>anatomy</MT> from the <MT>hair growth cycle</MT> to the hair <MT>pigmentation</MT>
if you are worried about hair loss and other hair related issues see your doctor to get your <MT>thyroid</MT>
constant fatigue and tiredness fatigue and extreme tiredness are very common in people who have an <MT>underactive thyroid</MT>
when low <MT>thyroid hormones</MT> flow through the <MT>blood cells</MT> do not function properly leading to less energy fatigue and constant tiredness
these symptoms persist even after getting proper sleep
study published in the european journal of endocrinology notes that <MT>autoimmune hypothyroidism</MT>
<MT>menstrual</MT> and <MT>fertility problems</MT> women with <MT>hypothyroidism</MT> may experience <MT>menstrual</MT>
<MT>thyroid hormones</MT> have great influence on <MT>menstruation thyroid pregnancy lactation</MT> and even <MT>uterine involution</MT> after childbirth
in fact the study puts emphasis on the assessment of <MT>thyroid function</MT> in all patients with <MT>menstrual disorders</MT> to avoid unnecessary interventions like <MT>curettage</MT> and <MT>hysterectomy</MT>
<MT>infertility</MT> can also be due to undiagnosed <MT>thyroidconditions</MT>
for any change in <MT>menstrual</MT> pattern as well as problems becoming pregnant it is important to get your <MT>thyroid</MT>

burn <MT>carbohydrates</MT> with <MT>antioxidants alpha lipoic acid thomas delauer</MT> did you know that the body is capable of producing its own antioxidants
one powerful antioxidant produced by the body is <MT>alpha lipoic acid</MT>
<MT>alpha lipoic acid </MT>is found in every cell of the human
both water soluble and <MT>fat</MT> soluble so able to act throughout the body
antioxidants attack <MT>free radicals</MT> which are waste products that occur when the body creates energy through the food we eat
<MT>free radicals</MT> can also come from exposure to toxins and pollutants
negative effects of <MT>free radicals</MT> include slows <MT>metabolism</MT> abnormal cell growth and <MT>proliferation</MT>
<MT>free radicals</MT> lead to cellular damage including damage to <MT>organs</MT>

<MT>ala for fat</MT> loss and building <MT>muscle</MT> multiple studies have found <MT>ala</MT>
one study followed <MT>obese</MT> <MT>diabetic patients</MT> for weeks with either <MT>mg supplementation of ala</MT> per day or <MT>placebo</MT> and found significant effect on body mass index and <MT>triglyceride levels</MT> decreasing <MT>bmi and triglyceride levels</MT> in the subjects with oral <MT>ala</MT> supplementation
protection against <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
<MT>insulin resistance</MT> leads to decreased <MT>glucose</MT> uptake in <MT>fat</MT> and <MT>muscle cells</MT>
<MT>ala</MT> helps to turn <MT>glucose</MT> into energy or fuel for your body through <MT>insulin</MT> signaling when <MT>insulin</MT> binds to the <MT>insulin receptor</MT> cascade of events is started leading to increased <MT>cellular glucose uptake</MT>
<MT>ala</MT> has been shown to activate this cascade of events leading to increased <MT>glucose uptake</MT> in <MT>fat</MT> and <MT>muscle cells</MT>
this is done not through an effect on <MT>insulin levels</MT> but by triggering the same sequence of events leading to <MT>glucose transport</MT> for energy creation
<MT>ala</MT> sort of mimics <MT>insulin</MT>
studies have shown that this shuttling allows more <MT>glucose</MT> to enter <MT>skeletal muscle cells</MT> thus more <MT>glucose</MT> burned as for energy more energy to tear and rebuild <MT>muscles</MT> and less shuttled to be stored as <MT>fat</MT>
when more <MT>glucose</MT> is delivered to <MT>muscle cells</MT> there is less available to be stored as <MT>fat</MT>
so you have more fuel to push <MT>muscle</MT> growth and less <MT>glucose</MT> stored in <MT>fat cells muscle</MT> growth and less <MT>fat</MT>

lose weight without <MT>hcg</MT> instead use asap
<MT>hcg</MT> is fast weight loss for sure but you must go to the doctor to get <MT>injections of the hcg hormone</MT>
asap is not <MT>hcg</MT> but <MT>protein fragments</MT> and <MT>amino acids</MT> as well as <MT>tribulus terrestris extract</MT>
asap contains only certified grade raw materials and is made in the usa
asap also helps you lose weight fast by focusing on losing abnormal <MT>fat</MT> without <MT>hormones</MT> asap allows you to <MT>burn abnormal fat</MT> stores as fuel and helps reset your <MT>metabolism</MT>
if you are on <MT>low calorie diet</MT> you burn structural and normal <MT>fat</MT> stores in your body
asap focuses on <MT>burning abnormal fat</MT> while you follow low <MT>fat</MT> low <MT>carbohydrate diet</MT> for to weeks this will reset your <MT>hypothalamus</MT> so your body can burn <MT>fat</MT>
what is asap
asap contains protein fractions and <MT>amino acids</MT> that allow your body to release the abnormal <MT>fat</MT>
asap contains only certified grade raw materials processed according to good manufacturing practices and is made in the usa
asap program for success every human body has different types of <MT>fat</MT> structural <MT>visceral fat</MT> in and around <MT>muscles</MT> cushioning <MT>organs</MT> padding of bottoms of feet
normal <MT>dermal fat</MT> is directly under the skins surface and provides the soft cushioning between the skin and frame of the body
abnormal <MT>adipose fat</MT> is under the <MT>dermal fat</MT> and not available for use by the <MT>metabolism</MT> until the other kinds of <MT>fat</MT>
<MT>abnormal fat</MT> can be viewed as <MT>famine fat</MT>
it is stored by the body for emergency
yo yo dieting contributes to the storage of this type of <MT>fat</MT> because the body
when calories are restricted the body stores all the <MT>fat</MT>
most typical reduced <MT>calorie diets</MT> will not produce the best results for those individuals with an abundance of abnormal <MT>fat</MT> stores because their bodies will begin by burning the wrong kind of <MT>fat</MT>
when low <MT>calorie diet</MT> is introduced to the system the normal reserves of <MT>fat</MT>
as result most people look gaunt and drawn after reduced <MT>calorie diet</MT>
although the normal reserves of <MT>fat</MT> have been reduced the abnormal <MT>fat</MT>
the asap program supports your body function to burn</MT> the abnormal <MT>adipose fat</MT>

<MT>leptin</MT> and the neural circuit regulation food intake and <MT>glucose metabolism</MT> air date wednesday january pm category wals wednesday afternoon lectures runtime description nih director wednesday afternoon lecture series the discovery of <MT>leptin</MT> has led to the <MT>elucidation</MT> of robust physiologic system that maintains <MT>fat</MT> stores at relatively constant level
<MT>leptin</MT> is <MT>peptide hormone</MT> secreted by <MT>adipose tissue</MT> in proportion to its mass
this <MT>hormone</MT> circulates in <MT>blood</MT> and acts on the <MT>hypothalamus</MT> to regulate food intake and <MT>energy expenditure</MT>
when <MT>fat</MT> mass falls <MT>plasma</MT> <MT>leptin</MT> levels fall stimulating appetite and suppressing <MT>energy expenditure</MT>
when <MT>fat</MT> mass increases <MT>leptin</MT>
by such mechanism total energy stores are stably maintained within relatively narrow range
recessive mutations in the <MT>leptin</MT> gene are associated with massive <MT>obesity</MT>
treatment with recombinant <MT>leptin</MT> markedly reduces food intake
the low <MT>leptin</MT> levels in patients with <MT>leptin</MT> mutations are also associated with multiple abnormalities including <MT>infertility diabetes</MT> and <MT>immune abnormalities</MT> all of which are corrected by <MT>leptin</MT> treatment
these findings have established important links between energy stores and many other <MT>physiologic systems</MT> and led to the use of <MT>leptin</MT> as treatment for an increasing number of other human conditions including subset of <MT>obesity</MT> some forms of <MT>diabetes</MT> including <MT>lipodystrophy</MT> and <MT>hypothalamic amenorrhea</MT> the <MT>cessation of menstruation</MT>
identification of physiologic system that controls energy balance establishes biologic basis for <MT>obesity</MT>
recent studies have explored the relationship between <MT>leptin</MT>
in addition new methods for identifying <MT>neurons</MT> activated by <MT>leptin</MT> and other stimuli have been developed as have methods for <MT>noninvasively activating cells</MT>
these new approaches are being applied to studies

am now able to offer the same <MT>hcg</MT> program
contact our office at castellowellness gmail com
<MT>hcg</MT> stands for <MT>human chorionic gonadotropin</MT>
it is <MT>hormone</MT> released during pregnancy
it rises when you become pregnant and is detectable in the <MT>blood</MT> and <MT>urine</MT> and is the basis
when <MT>hcg</MT> is given to non pregnant people on <MT>very low calorie diet</MT> it helps them to lose more weight and burn greater percentage of <MT>fat</MT>
the body has three types of <MT>fat</MT> structural <MT>fat</MT> reserve <MT>fat</MT> and abnormal <MT>fat</MT> tummy hips
<MT>hcg</MT> helps your body burn
since you are getting calories from your stored <MT>fat</MT>
and you don feel hungry
if you were to only eat calories day without <MT>hcg</MT> you would mainly slow your <MT>metabolism</MT> begin to burn <MT>muscle</MT> and start burning your reserve and structural <MT>fat</MT> not your abnormal <MT>fat</MT>
the <MT>hcg diet</MT> involves taking <MT>hcg</MT> once day preferably as an injection but also available as <MT>sublingual</MT> under the <MT>tongue</MT> drops
you eat very low <MT>calorie diet</MT>
you can have unlimited water
twice day you will eat small meal consisting of ounces of lean protein
you can also spread out the items in each meal
for example fruit for breakfast chicken melba toast and lettuce for lunch fish melba toast and asparagus for dinner and fruit as an after dinner snack
the <MT>hcg</MT> helps to suppress hunger keeps your <MT>metabolism</MT> up and helps to burn abnormal <MT>fat</MT>
you should never do such low calorie diet without medical supervision
the actions and benefits of the <MT>hcg diet</MT>
what can tell you is when patients in my office do the diet with injection
this is substantially more weight loss than would expect with diet
my theory on why <MT>hcg</MT> allows this success is as follows
from cave man perspective if you ate calories day that would signal that there was shortage of food and your body
this triggers slow down in <MT>metabolism</MT> to match food intake and prevent
the exception would be if you were pregnant you wouldn want to slow your <MT>metabolism</MT> and it would be great time to burn your <MT>fat</MT>
that would allow you to not only survive the pregnancy
be careful where you get your <MT>hcg</MT>
the <MT>fda</MT> has cracked down on on line
most online <MT>hcg</MT> comes from the urine of pregnant women in countries like india
injections
pharmaceutical grade <MT>hcg</MT> comes from synthetic origin not pregnant women and is manufactured in the usa by licensed manufacturers and is certified for purity and potency

learn about the best ways to burn <MT>fat</MT>
if you re interested in finding out how to lose belly <MT>fat</MT>
you ll learn about how to lose weight with these exercise and diet
free week challenge most people associate <MT>fat</MT> loss with long grinding
and even though <MT>fat</MT> loss does require work and effort in today video id like to go over the best ways to burn <MT>fat</MT>
when it comes to losing weight and burning <MT>fat</MT> adjusting your diet is gonna be the number one thing you can do to notice the most results so in this video will be going over ways you can burn <MT>fat</MT> faster with both your diet and your workout plan
lets start with the very first method
hirt stands for high intensity resistance training which is little different from hiit which stands for high intensity interval training im sure you guys have heard of hiit but im not so sure you ve heard
both are very similar but while hiit is much more centered around <MT>cardiovascular</MT> movements hirt is essentially strength training for <MT>fat</MT> loss
during hirt workout you ll perform series of strength training
this causes your <MT>heart rate</MT> to stay elevated and your <MT>muscles</MT> will be given very little time to recover
the really awesome thing about this type of workout is that you can build muscle increase endurance and burn
since your break time is gonna be short like to seconds you don
stick to moderate weight load and mix together to five of your weight training exercises back
at the end of that circuit take to second break and then repeat
sample upper body
you would do each of these exercises for <MT>reps</MT> and then repeat this series of exercises
after completing the sets you would want to move on to another series of exercises
the second thing you can do to burn <MT>fat</MT> faster is an aggressive <MT>fat</MT> loss diet
most diet plans
and most people are still under the impression that any diet plan
well can tell you for fact that this is untrue
many people start diet plan and they have lot of weight to lose so they do the traditional cut
now that considering that everything went right over the course of the eight weeks but even in this situation you can see
so demotivator that they might get on the scale
so for people that do have lot of weight to lose highly recommend you go for more aggressive <MT>fat</MT> loss plan
you would set up more aggressive <MT>fat</MT> loss plan
the reason why say set period of time is because forty to percent reduction
you want to have long term diet plan set up so you can transition into that after doing this more aggressive <MT>fat</MT> loss plan
and just note here on this topic you want to be smart about doing an aggressive diet plan
binge eating is more likely to happen when you re really hungry
so when you start feeling hungry or deprived or tired just throw in day of more regular reduction
this will help you reset so you can go back to bigger deficit
the next thing you can do to burn MT>fat</MT> faster is <MT>peripheral heart action training</MT> also known as <MT>pha</MT>
<MT>pha</MT> is kind of similar to hirt and hiit type training because you re going to be doing circuits that involve multiple exercises being done back
however the major difference is that you re going to alternate between upper and lower body movements
now this might not sound like big change but if you try it you ll notice yourself breathingreally heavy as soon as you get to your second exercise
the reason why it works like this is because whenever you work muscle or <MT>group of muscles</MT> your <MT>heart</MT> pumps
<MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is probably the most serious medical condition that you haven heard
so what is <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> why is it so serious and why haven you heard
here is what you need to know
the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is cluster of the most dangerous <MT>heart attack</MT> risk factors <MT>raised blood glucose central adiposity</MT> often called beer belly abnormal <MT>cholesterol levels</MT> abnormal <MT>blood fats</MT> also called <MT>triglycerides</MT> and <MT>high blood pressure</MT>
it is estimated that in adults have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and the condition becomes more common as we get older so that by the age of nearly third of adults have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
so why is <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
well if you have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> you are much more likely to suffer <MT>heart attack</MT> or stroke more likely to develop full blown <MT>diabetes</MT> more likely to develop cancer and more likely to develop <MT>alzheimer disease</MT>
all of these conditions
<MT>dementia</MT> and <MT>alzheimer disease</MT> have overtaken cancer and <MT>heart disease</MT> as the leading cause of death in england and wales in and the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and <MT>diabetes</MT>
so how can you check to see if you have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
well first of all get out tape measure
if you are man and your waist circumference is more than cm or if you are woman and your waist is more than cm you have one of the main features of <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
if in addition you have any of the following you will be classified as having <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> <MT>raised blood triglycerides</MT> <MT>reduced hdl cholesterol</MT> sometimes known as good <MT>cholesterol</MT> <MT>raised blood pressure</MT> or <MT>raised fasting plasma glucose</MT>
note if you are man of south asian or indian heritage the important threshold for waist circumference is cm
<MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> has not yet been classified as <MT>disease</MT> it is still regarded as collection of signs and symptoms which together are serious risk factors for our most deadly and disabling medical conditions
several medical organisations such as the world health organisation who the independent <MT>diabetes</MT> federation idf and the european group for the study of <MT>insulin resistance</MT> egir define the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> in very slightly different ways and this adds even more to the confusion about what exactly <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
however many experts now believe that the underlying problem in <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
<MT>insulin resistance</MT> develops when this <MT>hormone</MT> cannot work properly when <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> are abnormally high and still relatively ineffective in keeping <MT>blood glucose levels</MT>
metabolic specialists now use the term <MT>insulin resistance syndrome</MT>
<MT>insulin</MT> is <MT>hormone</MT> produced by the <MT>pancreas</MT> and it is important in the <MT>metabolism</MT> of <MT>carbohydrates</MT> and <MT>fats</MT>
when sugar and <MT>carbohydrates</MT> are eaten <MT>insulin</MT> promotes the uptake of <MT>glucose</MT> from the <MT>blood</MT> into <MT>muscles</MT> and <MT>fat cells</MT>
hence it is often said that <MT>insulin</MT> allows cells to use <MT>glucose</MT> for energy and also to store excess <MT>glucose</MT> and sugar as <MT>glycogen</MT> and <MT>fat</MT>
when <MT>blood glucose levels</MT> fall stored <MT>glucose</MT> is released for energy from the breakdown of <MT>glycogen</MT> stores in the <MT>liver</MT> and in the <MT>muscles</MT>
in the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
fasting <MT>blood levels of insulin</MT> in the morning are often abnormally high and <MT>insulin levels</MT> rise to very high levels when food is eaten
continuously high <MT>levels of insulin</MT> cause the <MT>liver cells</MT> to store <MT>fat</MT> resulting in <MT>fatty liver</MT> which cannot function
as the <MT>insulin resistance</MT> worsens the <MT>pancreas</MT> may not be able to produce enough <MT>insulin</MT> in response to food and then <MT>glucose levels in the blood</MT>
so why haven you heard
well until quite recently the connection between <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and host of <MT>chronic diseases</MT>
we now know that <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
until recently it was difficult to measure <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> but the technology has improved and we can now measure <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> accurately and we have good tests to diagnose <MT>insulin resistance</MT> as well as good strategies to reverse <MT>insulin resistance</MT> and the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
once you can measure <MT>insulin resistance</MT> you are well on your way to fixing

eating these foods makes you burn <MT>fat</MT>
sometimes the fight gets to be downright discouraging as you count your calories and exercise but you still see the scale
with little bit of information you can actually make the food you eat
knowing which foods help you burn calories or make you feel satisfied so you ll eat less may be all it takes to turn the tide in your favor listed below are foods that can help you burn away the belly bulge simply by eating them muscle building foods proteins are an excellent way to help build and maintain body
they are also harder for the body to break down which means they burn
all nuts are excellent sources of protein
an added benefit to nuts is that they help you feel full faster grass fed
unfortunately beef has gotten bad rap today
dr axe recommends grass fed beef as an excellent source of protein and healthy <MT>fats</MT> which can help build muscle and burn calories in the process
as easy sources of protein
women health shares that they also help build healthybones chicken
besides being great source of protein dr axe shares that chicken has the added benefit of satisfying food cravings causing you to stop eating
according to women health peanut butter is an excellent source of <MT>testosterone</MT> an essential component in maintaining <MT>muscle</MT>
it also helps with burning <MT>fat</MT> as it builds muscle satiating foods eating fruits and vegetables is great but often leaves you hungry
knowing what foods help satisfy hunger or make you feel full faster can help curb your appetite apple cider vinegar
according to dr axe taking one to two tablespoons of vinegar before your meal can help curb your sugar
besides being an excellent source of protein webmd points out that greek yogurt is extra filling keeping you from eating as much food cinnamon
cinnamon has many health benefits but big one is curbing the appetite
webmd recommends putting it in your morning coffee or tea <MT>metabolism</MT> boosting foods speeding up your <MT>metabolism</MT> is great way to burn
some foods will actually speed your <MT>metabolism</MT>
hot and spicy foods are great <MT>metabolism</MT> boosters
any hot pepper will do the job according to webmd and it will add burst of flavor at the same time grapefruit
on the opposite end of the spectrum from hot peppers is grapefruit
according to dr axe it contains <MT>enzymes</MT> that help break down sugar and boost your <MT>metabolism</MT>
no longer do you have to rely on simply counting calories and working out at the gym
you can make your food work for you
by being wise with what you eat
for those unfamiliar <MT>ketogenic dieting</MT> is any diet plan low carb enough to switch your body into state of producing and burning significant amount of <MT>ketones</MT> specifically <MT>acetoacetate acac</MT> and its derivatives <MT>beta hydroxybutyrate</MT> <MT>bhb</MT> and <MT>acetone</MT>
for those interested in background reading ve previously written summary articles about the science of fat <MT>metabolism</MT> and <MT>ketosis</MT>
these <MT>molecules</MT> especially <MT>acac and bhb</MT> are used by the <MT>brain</MT>
while the biological processes involved are extremely complex invite you to use this as the beginning of an important conversation for you and your doctor to explore together
indeed <MT>ketogenic dieting</MT> may or may not be appropriate for you so please consult with your doctor before experimenting on yourself
focusing the <MT>brain</MT> increased memory cognition clarity and seizure control less <MT>migraines ketogenic diets</MT> were notably first used at the mayo clinic in the to treat
while the exact mechanism of seizure prevention on <MT>ketogenic diet</MT> is still mystery researchers believe it has something to do with the increased stability of <MT>neurons</MT> and up regulation of <MT>brain</MT> <MT>mitochondria</MT> and <MT>mitochondrial enzymes</MT>
related to this research some serious attention has been given to <MT>ketogenic dieting</MT> and <MT>alzheimers disease</MT>
scientists have discovered increased cognition and enhanced memory in adults with impairments in these areas and growing body of research shows improvement at all stages of <MT>dementia</MT>
<MT>ketosis</MT> has been shown to be effective against <MT>parkinson disease</MT>
for broader audience of dieters the often reported side effects of increased mental clarity and focus and less frequent and less intense <MT>migraines</MT> are likely related to the more stable <MT>blood sugar</MT> and altered <MT>brain chemistry</MT>
fighting some types of cancer dom agostino lab published an article in entitled <MT>ketone</MT> supplementation decreases <MT>tumor cell</MT> viability and prolongs survival of mice with <MT>metastatic cells</MT> express an abnormal <MT>metabolism</MT> characterized by increased <MT>glucose</MT> consumption
previous studies indicate that unlike healthy <MT>tissues cancer cells</MT> are unable to effectively use <MT>ketone</MT> bodies
furthermore <MT>ketones</MT> inhibit the <MT>proliferation</MT> and viability of <MT>cultured tumor cells</MT>
preventing <MT>heart disease</MT> lower <MT>blood pressure</MT> lower <MT>triglycerides</MT> better <MT>cholesterol</MT> profiles again related to the downstream effects of keeping <MT>blood glucose</MT> low and stable <MT>ketogenic dieting</MT> helps keep <MT>blood pressure</MT> in check and lowers <MT>triglyceride levels</MT>
while it may seem counterintuitive that eating higher percentage of <MT>fat</MT> in your diet <MT>lowers triglycerides</MT> it turns out that the consumption of excess carbs especially <MT>fructose</MT> is the key driver of increasing <MT>triglycerides</MT>
and regarding <MT>hdl</MT> and <MT>ldl particles</MT> which the body uses to move <MT>fat</MT> and <MT>cholesterol</MT> around <MT>ketogenic dieting</MT> helps raise <MT>hdl good cholesterol</MT> and improve the profile of <MT>ldl bad cholesterol</MT>
improving energy levels and sleep by day or on <MT>ketogenic diet</MT> most people report an increase in general energy levels and lack of cravings for carbs
the mechanism here involves both stabilization of <MT>insulin</MT> levels and readily available source of energy for our <MT>brain</MT>
sleep
studies have shown that <MT>ketogenic dieting</MT> improves sleep by decreasing <MT>rem</MT> and increasing slow wave sleep
while the exact mechanism is unclear it likely is related to the complex biochemical shifts involving the <MT>brain</MT> use of <MT>ketones</MT> for energy combined with other body tissues directly burning
an important caveat is that <MT>ketogenic diet</MT> temporarily raises <MT>uric acid</MT> levels especially when <MT>dehydrated</MT> but over time they come down
combined with tons of <MT>anecdotal</MT> evidence over the years there is an entire movement behind bodybuilders using ketogenic approach to gain more muscle and less <MT>fat</MT> typically muscle gain also comes with <MT>fat</MT> gain so there understandable attention being given toward preventing
in addition dr stephen phinney and dr jeff volek have number of papers published about <MT>ketogenic dieting</MT> for ultra
in short once these athletes are fully <MT>fat</MT> adapted there is evidence to suggest that mental and physical performance is significantly improved beyond normal <MT>carbohydrate</MT>
and last but not least curbing diabetes <MT>obesity</MT> and <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>

<MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is probably the most serious medical condition that you haven heard
so what is <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> why is it so serious and why haven you heard
here is what you need to know
the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is cluster of the most dangerous <MT>heart attack</MT> risk factors <MT>raised blood glucose central adiposity</MT> often called beer belly abnormal <MT>cholesterol levels</MT> abnormal <MT>blood fats</MT> also called <MT>triglycerides</MT> and <MT>high blood pressure</MT>
it is estimated that in adults have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and the condition becomes more common as we get older so that by the age of nearly third of adults have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
so why is <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
well if you have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> you are much more likely to suffer <MT>heart attack</MT> or stroke more likely to develop full blown <MT>diabetes</MT> more likely to develop cancer and more likely to develop <MT>alzheimer disease</MT>
all of these conditions
<MT>dementia</MT> and <MT>alzheimer disease</MT> have overtaken cancer and <MT>heart disease</MT> as the leading cause of< death in england and wales in and the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> and <MT>diabetes</MT>
so how can you check to see if you have <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
well first of all get out tape measure
if you are man and your waist circumference is more than cm or if you are woman and your waist is more than cm you have one of the main features of <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
if in addition you have any of the following you will be classified as having <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> <MT>raised blood triglycerides</MT> <MT>reduced hdl cholesterol</MT> sometimes known as good <MT>cholesterol</MT> <MT>raised blood pressure</MT> or <MT>raised fasting plasma glucose</MT>
note if you are man of south asian or indian heritage the important threshold for waist circumference is cm
<MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> has not yet been classified as <MT>disease</MT> it is still regarded as collection of signs and symptoms which together are serious risk factors for our most deadly and disabling medical conditions
several medical organisations such as the world health organisation who the independent <MT>diabetes</MT> federation idf and the european group for the study of <MT>insulin resistance</MT> egir define the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> in very slightly different ways and this adds even more to the confusion about what exactly <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
however many experts now believe that the underlying problem in <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT> is <MT>insulin resistance</MT>
<MT>insulin resistance</MT> develops when this <MT>hormone</MT> cannot work properly when <MT>blood insulin levels</MT> are abnormally high and still relatively ineffective in keeping <MT>blood glucose levels</MT>
metabolic specialists now use the term <MT>insulin resistance syndrome</MT>
<MT>insulin</MT> is <MT>hormone</MT> produced by the <MT>pancreas</MT> and it is important in the <MT>metabolism</MT> of <MT>carbohydrates</MT> and <MT>fats</MT>
when sugar and <MT>carbohydrates</MT> are eaten <MT>insulin</MT> promotes the uptake of <MT>glucose</MT> from the <MT>blood</MT> into <MT>muscles</MT> and <MT>fat cells</MT>
hence it is often said that <MT>insulin</MT> allows cells to use <MT>glucose</MT> for energy and also to store excess <MT>glucose</MT> and sugar as <MT>glycogen</MT> and <MT>fat</MT>
when <MT>blood glucose levels</MT> fall stored <MT>glucose</MT> is released for energy from the breakdown of <MT>glycogen</MT> stores in the <MT>liver</MT> and in the <MT>muscles</MT>
in the <MT>metabolic syndrome</MT>
fasting <MT>blood levels of insulin</MT> in the morning are often abnormally high and <MT>insulin levels</MT> rise to very high levels when food is eaten
continuously <MT>high levels of insulin</MT> cause the <MT>liver cells</MT> to store <MT>fat</MT> resulting in <MT>fatty liver</MT> which cannot function
as the <MT>insulin resistance</MT> worsens the <MT>pancreas</MT> may not be able to produce enough <MT>insulin</MT> in response to food and then <MT>glucose levels in the blood</MT>

want to lose weight and melt <MT>fat</MT>
unique kit
bt wdpfua the science behind hcgin the dr
simeons
was looking for cure for <MT>obesity</MT>
his research on this subject spanned over years mostly from his lab in italy whereby he found what many call the holy grail of weight loss he founded the research that lead to <MT>hcg</MT> weight loss
dr simeons found that given the right circumstances people could lose as much as pound of pure <MT>fat</MT>
not lean muscle or water weight but <MT>fat</MT>
most people thought it crazy to lose pound per day and still be healthy
it true dr
over the years other doctors began studying dr simeons unique protocol and taking it back
most came to the same conclusion which was that people were not just losing pounds and inches but they were able to keep it off using the <MT>hcg program</MT>
the answer is in understanding how the body
the human body has three kinds of <MT>fat</MT>
the first is the structural <MT>fat</MT> which fills the gaps between various <MT>organs</MT> sort of packing material
structural <MT>fat</MT> also performs important functions as bedding the <MT>kidneys</MT> in <MT>soft elastic tissue</MT> protecting the <MT>coronary arteries</MT> and keeping the skin
it also provides the springy cushion of hard fat under the <MT>bones of the feet</MT>
the second type is called the normal <MT>fat</MT>
the normal <MT>fat</MT> reserve is drawn upon when the nutritional income from the <MT>intestinal tract</MT> is insufficient to meet the demand
such normal reserves are localized all over the body
<MT>fat</MT> is substance which packs the highest caloric value into the smallest space so that normal reserves of fuel for muscular activity and the maintenance of body temperature
both these types of <MT>fat</MT> structural and reserve are normal and even if the body stocks them to capacity this can never be called <MT>obesity</MT>
the third type of <MT>fat</MT> is abnormal <MT>fat</MT>
it is the accumulation of abnormal <MT>fat</MT> that is found in people who are <MT>obese</MT>
this abnormal <MT>fat</MT> is also potential reserve of fuel but unlike the normal reserves it is not available to the body in nutritional emergency
the reason the abnormal <MT>fat</MT>
typical dieters will lose normal <MT>fat</MT> reserves first and then move onto the structural <MT>fat</MT>
by the time people get to the point that they can target the abnormal <MT>fat</MT> they have become too week and too hungry and don quite get there how is  <MT>hcg fat</MT> loss like money if you look at it like money abnormal <MT>fat</MT> is non liquid asset and reserve <MT>fat</MT> is like cash or liquid
your body can use reserve <MT>fat</MT> immediately on demand
but abnormal <MT>fat</MT> sometimes referred to as stubborn <MT>fat</MT> cannot be accessed on demand
there is special process that must occur in order for you to access your abnormal <MT>fat</MT>
much like the process you must go through to access non liquid assets be it the selling of stocks and bonds or even selling
in these latter cases your money is tied up and not immediately accessible
this video presents discussion on ectopic <MT>fat</MT> depots by three experts in this area dr ulf smith from sweden dr marja riitta taskinen from finland and dr
dr smith introduces the notion of ectopic <MT>fat</MT>
dr taskinen explains that the <MT>liver</MT> is very <MT>central organ</MT> because of its importance in the <MT>metabolism</MT> of <MT>triglyceride</MT> rich <MT>lipoproteins</MT>
an imbalance in <MT>lipid metabolism</MT> may cause <MT>fatty liver</MT> and an <MT>atherogenic</MT>
moreover she explains that in addition to <MT>fat</MT> accumulation in the <MT>liver</MT> and in <MT>visceral depots lipids</MT> can also accumulate around the <MT>heart</MT>
dr jensen recalls that some individuals are able to expand their <MT>fat</MT> <MT>depot</MT> and remain healthy while others with the same amount or even less <MT>adipose tissue expansion</MT>
in this case when <MT>adipose tissue</MT> cannot properly store <MT>lipids</MT> the excess energy ends up in the <MT>liver</MT> the <MT>heart</MT> and the <MT>muscle cells</MT>
several mechanisms are proposed by dr

the condition
when this process of <MT>fat metabolism</MT> is disrupted the <MT>fat</MT> can accumulate in the <MT>liver</MT> in excessive amounts thus resulting in <MT>fatty liver</MT>
it is difficult to distinguish alcoholic fld from nonalcoholic fld and both show microvesicular and macrovesicular fatty changes at different stages
