ways your body tries to tell you that your liver is being damaged the liver is the largest solid organ in your body .
it is located in the right upper quadrant of your abdomen and partly protected by the ribs .
you need your liver for many important bodily functions and cannot live without your liver .
for this reason you should know the early signs of liver damage and take care of your liver .
there are more than hundred different kinds of diseases of the liver .
each has its own set of symptoms .
some of these diseases include alcoholic liver disease hepatitis fatty liver disease and cirrhosis of the liver .
the early signs of liver disease tend to be easily overlooked and are non specific related to any number of different conditions .
here are some common early signs .
upset stomach you are likely to get nausea and vomiting .
they can mimic other diseases such as migraines food poisoning vertigo motion sickness early pregnancy depression and vomiting .
it can mimic kidney problems .
those who suffer from early liver damage often feel persistently nauseous because the liver has decreased ability to rid the body of toxins .
the nausea can also be due to ongoing metabolism and changes in digestion .
if you have these symptoms for several days and don know why seek the attention of your doctor .
fatigue and overall weakness one of the early and obvious signs of liver damage is constantly feeling tired and weak .
when the liver is not in great condition the body .
this is due to an increase in toxins in the bloodstream that can be cleared out because the liver can get rid of the toxins .
if the symptoms persist especially with other early signs of liver damage seek medical advice .
lack of appetite this happens due to lack of production of bile that helps digest fat in the diet .
when food isn properly digested it can lead to lack of appetite and severe loss of weight .
see your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms .
digestion problems the liver is important in digestion because it makes bile that helps the nutrients be better processed and absorbed by the small intestines .
if the liver is failing you can develop an increase in indigestion and diarrhea .
if the bile is not produced properly you can also experience irritable bowel syndrome fatty food intolerance alcohol intolerance abdominal bloating constipation and gallstones .
if this becomes severe you need to seek the medical attention of doctor .
alterations in the color of urine if you think you are drinking enough but still have dark color of your urine this may be one of the early signs of liver damage .
the urine may look brown amber or orange in color because of elevated levels of bilirubin in the bloodstream .
the bilirubin is elevated because the liver cannot get rid of the bilirubin and it is excreted through the kidneys .
dark urine may also be due to dehydration side effects of taking antibiotics taking vitamin supplements urinary tract infections enzyme deficiencies or kidney abnormalities .
the doctor can help sort out the cause of dark urine .
changes in stool coloration because the bile is not made enough by malfunctioning liver .
instead of being brown it can become pale yellow clay colored or gray in appearance .
if this happens periodically it is not dangerous but if it happens often seek the advice of your doctor to check out your liver .
metabolic syndrome is probably the most serious medical condition .
so what is metabolic syndrome why is it so serious and why haven you heard .
here is what you need to know .
the metabolic syndrome is cluster of the most dangerous heart attack risk factors raised blood glucose central adiposity often called beer belly abnormal cholesterol levels abnormal blood fats also called triglycerides and high blood pressure .
it is estimated that in adults have metabolic syndrome and the condition becomes more common as we get older so that by the age of nearly third of adults have metabolic syndrome .
so why is metabolic syndrome .
well if you have metabolic syndrome you are much more likely to suffer heart attack or stroke more likely to develop full blown diabetes more likely to develop cancer and more likely to develop alzheimer disease .
all of these conditions .
dementia and alzheimer disease have overtaken cancer and heart disease as the leading cause of death in england and wales in and the metabolic syndrome and diabetes .
so how can you check to see if you have metabolic syndrome .
well first of all get out tape measure .
if you are man and your waist circumference is more than cm or if you are woman and your waist is more than cm you have one of the main features of metabolic syndrome .
if in addition you have any of the following you will be classified as having metabolic syndrome raised blood triglycerides reduced hdl cholesterol sometimes known as good cholesterol raised blood pressure or raised fasting plasma glucose .
note if you are man of south asian or indian heritage the important threshold for waist circumference is cm .
metabolic syndrome has not yet been classified as disease it is still regarded as collection of signs and symptoms which together are serious risk factors for our most deadly and disabling medical conditions .
several medical organisations such as the world health organisation who the independent diabetes federation idf and the european group for the study of insulin resistance egir define the metabolic syndrome in very slightly different ways and this adds even more to the confusion about what exactly metabolic syndrome .
however many experts now believe that the underlying problem in metabolic syndrome is insulin resistance .
insulin resistance develops when this hormone cannot work properly when blood insulin levels are abnormally high and still relatively ineffective in keeping blood glucose levels .
metabolic specialists now use the term insulin resistance syndrome instead of metabolic syndrome .
insulin is hormone produced by the pancreas and it is important in the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats .
when sugar and carbohydrates are eaten insulin promotes the uptake of glucose from the blood into muscles and fat cells .
hence it is often said that insulin allows cells to use glucose for energy and also to store excess glucose and sugar as glycogen and fat .
when blood glucose levels fall stored glucose is released for energy from the breakdown of glycogen stores in the liver and in the muscles .
in the metabolic syndrome insulin levels .
fasting blood levels of insulin in the morning are often abnormally high and insulin levels rise to very high levels when food is eaten .
continuously high levels of insulin cause the liver cells to store fat resulting in fatty liver .
as the insulin resistance worsens the pancreas may not be able to produce enough insulin in response to food and then glucose levels in the blood rise above the threshold for the patient to be called diabetic .
so why haven you heard of metabolic syndrome .
well until quite recently the connection between metabolic syndrome and host of chronic diseases .
we now know that insulin resistance .
until recently it was difficult to measure blood insulin levels but the technology has improved and we can now measure blood insulin levels accurately and we have good tests to diagnose insulin resistance as well as good strategies to reverse insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome .
once you can measure insulin resistance .
also get our diabetes management guide here this is great question because sometimes the term metabolic syndrome also called syndrome is used when discussing pre diabetes .
but the are not the same thing .
according to the mayo clinic metabolic syndrome is cluster of conditions increased blood pressure high blood sugar excess body fat around the waist and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels that occur together increasing your risk of heart disease stroke and diabetes .
having just one of these conditions doesn mean you have metabolic syndrome .
however any of these conditions increase your risk of serious disease .
having more than one of these might increase your risk even more .
an underlying cause of metabolic syndrome is insulin resistance condition that increases the chances of developing pre diabetes type diabetes and cardiovascular disease .
so an understanding of the interaction of insulin resistance metabolic syndrome and pre diabetes is critical to making lifestyle changes that can help you avoid type diabetes .
food is broken down in the body into glucose the simple sugar .
it is digested into many different macromolecules protein fat and carbohydrates .
then carbohydrates are broken down further into glucose which is the simple energy used by cells .
insulin allows this glucose to leave the blood stream and enter the cell where it can fuel the activities of that cell .
your pancreas makes and secretes insulin .
but glucose can enter the cells if your pancreas doesn manufacture enough insulin or your cells are unable to process the insulin that is present in the blood stream .
as result glucose levels become elevated setting the stage for pre diabetes .
tissues with too much fat produce fewer insulin receptors and are more resistant to insulin .
in vicious cycle the pancreas responds by pumping more insulin until the insulin producing cells die from exhaustion .
type diabetes .
when you are insulin resistant your muscle fat and liver cells do not use insulin .
the pancreas tries to keep up with the demand for insulin .
eventually the pancreas cannot keep up with the body need for insulin causing excess glucose to build up in the blood stream .
many people with insulin resistance have high levels of both blood glucose and insulin .
pre diabetes means you have higher risk of developing type diabetes .
studies have shown that most people with pre diabetes go on to develop type ii diabetes within years unless they make changes to their weight their diet and their levels of physical activity .
while both diabetes pre diabetes and metabolic syndrome have insulin resistance .

link to the study acetyl carnitine to the brain carnitine acts as reservoir of long chain fatty acids for incorporation into red blood cell membrane phospholipids during repair after oxidative insults it is also used in the synthesis of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine the major component of surfactant in lung .
carnitine can be used therapeutically to stimulate gastric and pancreatic secretions and in the treatment of hyperlipoproteinemias .
these nutrients are all required for carnitine synthesis magnesium vitamin iron vitamins and and alpha ketoglutarate along with the cofactors responsible for creating same methionine folic acid vitamin and betaine carnitine supplementation has improved some patients who have angina secondary to coronary artery disease .
carnitine supplements may be useful in many forms of toxic or metabolic liver disease and in cases of heart muscle disease .
hearts undergoing severe arrhythmia quickly deplete their stores of carnitine .
athletes particularly in europe have used carnitine .
carnitine may improve muscle building by improving fat utilization and may even be useful in treating obesity .
carnitine may be of value in treating pregnant women hypothyroid individuals and male infertility .
even the physician desk reference gives indication for carnitine supplements as improving the tolerance of ischemic heart disease myocardial insufficiencies and type iv hyperlipoproteinemia .
carnitine deficiency is noted in abnormal liver function renal dialysis patients and severe to moderate muscular weakness with associated anorexia patients with chronic fatigue syndrome cfs were found to have low free carnitine total carnitine and acylcarnitine compared to controls carnitine is peripheral antagonist of thyroid .
it inhibits thyroid hormone .
in controlled clinical trial carnitine was shown to reverse or prevent some symptoms of hyperthyroidism .
conditions associated with carnitine deficiency include cancer diabetes alzheimer disease and heart failure .
deficienies may result in accumulation of fat within skeletal muscle cardiac muscle and liver disruption of muscle fibers and an accumulation of large aggregates of mitochondria within skeletal .
deficiency can result in cardiomyopathy congestive heart failure encephalopathy hepatomegaly impaired growth and development in infants and neuromuscular disorders .
primary carnitine deficiency has symptoms such as muscle fatigue cramps and myoglobinemia following exercise .
additional symptoms of chronic carnitine deficiency can include hypoglycemia progressive myasthenia hypotonia or lethargy .
secondary carnitine deficiency is not as rare and is most commonly associated with dialysis in chronic renal failure although it can also be induced by intestinal resection severe infection and liver disease .

symptoms of potassium deficiency of any nutrient in the body is undesirable and potassium .
diet deficient in it may lead to symptoms like fatigue and muscle weakness .
other indications for its deficiency include inactive reflexes abnormal heartbeat heart palpitations anemia and severe headaches .
potassium deficient people may also experience high blood pressure pain in their intestines swelling in their glands and diabetes .
important sources of potassium .
also you can get an ample amount of this mineral .
apart from those nuts lime beans potatoes and poultry are other products to be included in the potassium .
however the important sources of this mineral also include avocados bananas and coconut water .
stabilizes blood sugar decrease in the potassium level causes drop in blood sugar .
decrease in blood sugar can cause sweating headache weakness trembling and nervousness .
intake of potassium chloride and sodium .
this is also why diabetics are encouraged to keep their potassium levels normal to reduce the chances of unpredictable spikes and plunges in their glucose and insulin levels by stabilizing the blood sugar levels .
reduces muscle disorders sufficient concentration of this mineral is required for the regular contraction .
most of the potassium ions in the human body are located in the muscle cells .
it maintains optimal muscle and nerve function and helps to keep our reflexes fast because it stimulates the neural connectivity of muscles and the brain .
prevents cramps muscle cramps are common result of low levels of potassium in the blood condition called hypokalemia .
if you consume banana every day you can easily prevent muscle cramps because bananas have rich potassium .
stabilizes blood pressure potassium is helpful in reversing the role of sodium .
thus it acts as vital component that maintains the normality of blood pressure in the human body .
this further reduces the risk of heart diseases and ypertension .
regulation of blood pressure is one of the most important functions of this powerful mineral .
as mentioned earlier it has vasodilation properties that work to relieve the tension of blood vessels which is one of the main causes of high blood pressure .
strengthens muscles one of the useful benefits of MT>potassium is its role in ensuring the proper growth of muscle tissues and the utilization of energy released during metabolism .
the muscle including those all important cardiac muscles are prone to paralysis due to deficiency of potassium in person diet .
stimulating cell growth and providing the metabolic energy to do so is vital function of potassium .
also without the contraction and relaxation that potassium allows muscles to perform exercise .
boosts metabolism potassium assists in the metabolic processing of various nutrients like fats and carbohydrates .
thus it is of great value in extracting the energy from nutrients that are consumed .
studies have shown that this mineral is also an integral part in the synthesis of protein which has an impact on tissue regeneration cell growth and an overall balanced metabolism .
boosts heart health the health benefits of potassium ensure good health for the heart as well as the kidneys .
it plays an irreplaceable role in regulating the functions of the metabolism and keeping the heart and kidney .
additionally this mineral assists the kidney in removing waste through the process of excretion .
however it is strongly advised to consult your doctor to get recommendations about potassium dosage because it can help to stimulate the body to absorb more calcium than necessary which can actually calcify and cause kidney problems .
regulates the level of fluids potassium is also great electrolyte .
it helps in regulating the level of fluids in the body and thus aids in number of critical body functions .
furthermore electrolytes help to transmit electrical charges throughout the body from the brain and nervous system so extra electrolytes .

signs that indicate problem with thyroid gland the thyroid located in the neck is vital body gland as it is responsible for numerous functions in the body .
it produces hormones that regulate the metabolism so the imbalance of those hormones severely affects the natural balance of the body .
yet the thyroid dysfunction is hard to be diagnosed as its symptoms .
therefore it is of high importance to recognize its symptoms .
these are the symptoms of thyroid issues that should not be ignored frequent pains in the muscles or joints this is an indication that should not be ignored so you must visit your doctor and check whether you are experiencing thyroid .
bloating and swelling hypothyroidism can often lead to bloating .
on the other hand if you notice swelling or puffiness in the face you should immediately check your thyroid gland .
trembling and anxiety sometimes the excessive production of thyroid hormones may lead to accelerated metabolism and thus can make you feel irritated nervous .
weight changes hypothyroidism can lead to unexplained weight gain and on the other hand hyperthyroidism can lead .
irregular menstruation thyroid problems can cause two kinds of abnormal menstruation hypothyroidism leads to extremely difficult and long menstruation and hyperthyroidism causes small flow or no menstrual cycle .
change in mental functions reduced levels of thyroid hormones cause constant fatigue and feelings of tiredness and dizziness .
abnormal reaction to the temperature outside in the case of thyroid gland disorders people may react differently to the temperature outside than others .
in the case of hyperthyroidism people feel abnormal warmness while the ones with hypothyroidism feel unnatural cold .

inhibit cancer growth many types of cancer cells have difficulty utilizing ketones .
getting ketones into our nutrition the average american will never see starvation or famine the conditions that historically triggered the endogenous production of ketones .
indeed more people will die worldwide this year of obesity related diseases than from hunger .
virtually no citizen will experience the consecutive days of starvation or undergo the multi day fast required to trigger their ketone .
until recently short of starvation the only other recognized way of including ketones in the diet was to induce the body to make them endogenously through low carbohydrate ketogenic type diet that forces glucose and insulin levels down thereby inducing the body to burn fatty acids to make ketones .
this approach requires strict dietary compliance making its widespread adoption impossible given the present american diet .
recent research in this field however has established an alternative method for including ketones .
by adding ketones to the diet consuming exogenous ketones many of the advantages of ketosis .
utilization of ketones will help return us to our natural state of nutritional energy balance .

descriptions of thyroid pain symptoms about percent of the united states population suffers .
the risk for developing hypothyroidism and infertility .
if you have multiple signs and symptoms of this problem ask your doctor to check your thyroid hormone levels and get treatment of thyroid .
here are the signs and symptoms that you have an underactive thyroid .
unexplained weight gain weight gain without any change in diet or physical activity may indicate low levels of thyroid hormones .
these hormones help regulate basal metabolism and thermogenesis as well as the metabolism of fats and glucose .
an underactive thyroid contributes to lower metabolic rate .
if you have unexplained weight gain it is essential to consult your doctor to determine the exact cause and get hypothyroidism .
dry and flaky skin if you are following your usual beauty and skin care regimen and haven changed any of the products you use but your skin is dry and itchy it could be symptom of hypothyroidism or thyroid dry skin .
the change in skin texture and appearance can be due to reduced blood circulation one of the side effects of having low thyroid hormones .
in addition slowed metabolism due to low thyroid hormone production can reduce sweating .
without proper sweating the skin becomes dry and flaky .
as these skin .
it is best to consult your doctor to see if there is an underlying health condition causing these skin changes .
muscle soreness and pain people suffering from hypothyroidism often experience muscle weakness pain stiffness or cramping .
there may also be general joint pain .
low metabolism disrupts how your body burns energy which can affect how your muscles .
low thyroid often increases inflammation that may be contributing to your muscle and joint pain .
in fact about percent of the hypothyroid patients had predominantly sensory signs of sensorimotor axonal neuropathy early in the course of thyroid disease .
hair losshypothyroidism hair loss and proper functioning of the thyroid gland is essential for the development and maintenance of the hair follicles and an underactive thyroid .
it may also affect eyebrows and body hair .
the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine modulate several aspects of hair anatomy from the hair growth cycle to the hair pigmentation .
if you are worried about hair loss and other hair related issues see your doctor to get your thyroid .
constant fatigue and tiredness fatigue and extreme tiredness are very common in people who have an underactive thyroid .
when low thyroid hormones flow through the blood cells do not function properly leading to less energy fatigue and constant tiredness .
these symptoms persist even after getting proper sleep .
study published in the european journal of endocrinology notes that autoimmune hypothyroidism .
menstrual and fertility problems women with hypothyroidism may experience menstrual .
thyroid hormones have great influence on menstruation thyroid pregnancy lactation and even uterine involution after childbirth .
in fact the study puts emphasis on the assessment of thyroid function in all patients with menstrual disorders to avoid unnecessary interventions like curettage and hysterectomy .
infertility can also be due to undiagnosed thyroidconditions .
for any change in menstrual pattern as well as problems becoming pregnant it is important to get your thyroid .

how else can ala .
ala for fat loss and building muscle multiple studies have found ala .
one study followed obese diabetic patients for weeks with either mg supplementation of ala per day or placebo and found significant effect on body mass index and triglyceride levels decreasing bmi and triglyceride levels in the subjects with oral ala supplementation .
protection against insulin resistance .
insulin resistance leads to decreased glucose uptake in fat and muscle cells .
ala helps to turn glucose into energy or fuel for your body through insulin signaling when insulin binds to the insulin receptor cascade of events is started leading to increased cellular glucose uptake .
ala has been shown to activate this cascade of events leading to increased glucose uptake in fat and muscle cells .
this is done not through an effect on insulin levels but by triggering the same sequence of events leading to glucose transport for energy creation .
ala sort of mimics insulin .
studies have shown that this shuttling allows more glucose to enter skeletal muscle cells thus more glucose burned as for energy more energy to tear and rebuild muscles and less shuttled to be stored as fat .
when more glucose is delivered to muscle cells there is less available to be stored as fat .
so you have more fuel to push muscle growth and less glucose stored in fat cells muscle growth and less fat .
other possible uses of ala ala is approved in germany as treatment for diabetes and for symptoms of diabetes .
cancer memory loss chronic fatigue syndrome hiv aids heart disease eye related disorders how to add alpha lipoic acid to your diet foods high in ala broccolispinach potatoes red meat organ .

leptin and the neural circuit regulation food intake and glucose metabolism air date wednesday january pm category wals wednesday afternoon lectures runtime description nih director wednesday afternoon lecture series the discovery of leptin has led to the elucidation of robust physiologic system that maintains fat stores at relatively constant level .
leptin is peptide hormone secreted by adipose tissue in proportion to its mass .
this hormone circulates in blood and acts on the hypothalamus to regulate food intake and energy expenditure .
when fat mass falls plasma leptin levels fall stimulating appetite and suppressing energy expenditure .
when fat mass increases leptin .
by such mechanism total energy stores are stably maintained within relatively narrow range .
recessive mutations in the leptin gene are associated with massive obesity .
treatment with recombinant leptin markedly reduces food intake .
the low leptin levels in patients with leptin mutations are also associated with multiple abnormalities including infertility diabetes and immune abnormalities all of which are corrected by leptin treatment .
these findings have established important links between energy stores and many other physiologic systems and led to the use of leptin as treatment for an increasing number of other human conditions including subset of obesity some forms of diabetes including lipodystrophy and hypothalamic amenorrhea the cessation of menstruation .
identification of physiologic system that controls energy balance establishes biologic basis for obesity .
recent studies have explored the relationship between leptin .
in addition new methods for identifying neurons activated by leptin and other stimuli have been developed as have methods for noninvasively activating cells .
these new approaches are being applied to studies .

when hcg is given to non pregnant people on very low calorie diet it helps them to lose more weight and burn greater percentage of fat .
the body has three types of fat structural fat reserve fat and abnormal fat tummy hips .
hcg helps your body burn .
since you are getting calories from your stored fat .
and you don feel hungry .
if you were to only eat calories day without hcg you would mainly slow your metabolism begin to burn muscle and start burning your reserve and structural fat not your abnormal fat .
the hcg diet involves taking hcg once day preferably as an injection but also available as sublingual under the tongue drops .
you eat very low calorie diet .
you can have unlimited water .
twice day you will eat small meal consisting of ounces of lean protein .
you can also spread out the items in each meal .
for example fruit for breakfast chicken melba toast and lettuce for lunch fish melba toast and asparagus for dinner and fruit as an after dinner snack .
the hcg helps to suppress hunger keeps your metabolism up and helps to burn abnormal fat .
you should never do such low calorie diet without medical supervision .
the actions and benefits of the hcg diet .
what can tell you is when patients in my office do the diet with injection .
this is substantially more weight loss than would expect with diet .
my theory on why hcg allows this success is as follows .
from cave man perspective if you ate calories day that would signal that there was shortage of food and your body .
this triggers slow down in metabolism to match food intake and prevent .
the exception would be if you were pregnant you wouldn want to slow your metabolism and it would be great time to burn your fat .
that would allow you to not only survive the pregnancy .
be careful where you get your hcg .
the fda has cracked down on on line .
most online hcg comes from the urine of pregnant women in countries like india .
injections .
pharmaceutical grade hcg comes from synthetic origin not pregnant women and is manufactured in the usa by licensed manufacturers and is certified for purity and potency .
the way how you can avoid overweight and lose fat overweight and obesity affect americans of all ages sexes .
this serious health problem has been growing over the last years .

learn about the best ways to burn fat .
if you re interested in finding out how to lose belly fat .
you ll learn about how to lose weight with these exercise and diet .
free week challenge most people associate fat loss with long grinding .
and even though fat loss does require work and effort in today video id like to go over the best ways to burn fat .
when it comes to losing weight and burning fat adjusting your diet is gonna be the number one thing you can do to notice the most results so in this video will be going over ways you can burn fat faster with both your diet and your workout plan .
lets start with the very first method .
hirt stands for high intensity resistance training which is little different from hiit which stands for high intensity interval training im sure you guys have heard of hiit but im not so sure you ve heard .
both are very similar but while hiit is much more centered around cardiovascular movements hirt is essentially strength training for fat loss .
during hirt workout you ll perform series of strength training .
this causes your heart rate to stay elevated and your muscles will be given very little time to recover .
the really awesome thing about this type of workout is that you can build muscle increase endurance and burn .
since your break time is gonna be short like to seconds you don .
stick to moderate weight load and mix together to five of your weight training exercises back .
at the end of that circuit take to second break and then repeat .
sample upper body .
you would do each of these exercises for reps and then repeat this series of exercises .
after completing the sets you would want to move on to another series of exercises .
the second thing you can do to burn fat faster is an aggressive fat loss diet .
most diet plans .
and most people are still under the impression that any diet plan .
well can tell you for fact that this is untrue .
many people start diet plan and they have lot of weight to lose so they do the traditional cut .
now that considering that everything went right over the course of the eight weeks but even in this situation you can see .
so demotivator that they might get on the scale .
so for people that do have lot of weight to lose highly recommend you go for more aggressive fat loss plan .
you would set up more aggressive fat loss plan .
the reason why say set period of time is because forty to percent reduction .
you want to have long term diet plan set up so you can transition into that after doing this more aggressive fat loss plan .
and just note here on this topic you want to be smart about doing an aggressive diet plan .
binge eating is more likely to happen when you re really hungry .
so when you start feeling hungry or deprived or tired just throw in day of more regular reduction .
this will help you reset so you can go back to bigger deficit .
the next thing you can do to burn MT>fat faster is peripheral heart action training also known as pha .
pha is kind of similar to hirt and hiit type training because you re going to be doing circuits that involve multiple exercises being done back .
however the major difference is that you re going to alternate between upper and lower body movements .
now this might not sound like big change but if you try it you ll notice yourself breathingreally heavy as soon as you get to your second exercise .
the reason why it works like this is because whenever you work muscle or group of muscles your heart pumps .
metabolic syndrome is probably the most serious medical condition that you haven heard .
so what is metabolic syndrome why is it so serious and why haven you heard .
here is what you need to know .
the metabolic syndrome is cluster of the most dangerous heart attack risk factors raised blood glucose central adiposity often called beer belly abnormal cholesterol levels abnormal blood fats also called triglycerides and high blood pressure .
it is estimated that in adults have metabolic syndrome and the condition becomes more common as we get older so that by the age of nearly third of adults have metabolic syndrome .
so why is metabolic syndrome .
well if you have metabolic syndrome you are much more likely to suffer heart attack or stroke more likely to develop full blown diabetes more likely to develop cancer and more likely to develop alzheimer disease .
all of these conditions .
dementia and alzheimer disease have overtaken cancer and heart disease as the leading cause of death in england and wales in and the metabolic syndrome and diabetes .
so how can you check to see if you have metabolic syndrome .
well first of all get out tape measure .
if you are man and your waist circumference is more than cm or if you are woman and your waist is more than cm you have one of the main features of metabolic syndrome .
if in addition you have any of the following you will be classified as having metabolic syndrome raised blood triglycerides reduced hdl cholesterol sometimes known as good cholesterol raised blood pressure or raised fasting plasma glucose .
note if you are man of south asian or indian heritage the important threshold for waist circumference is cm .
metabolic syndrome has not yet been classified as disease it is still regarded as collection of signs and symptoms which together are serious risk factors for our most deadly and disabling medical conditions .
several medical organisations such as the world health organisation who the independent diabetes federation idf and the european group for the study of insulin resistance egir define the metabolic syndrome in very slightly different ways and this adds even more to the confusion about what exactly metabolic syndrome .
however many experts now believe that the underlying problem in metabolic syndrome is insulin resistance .
insulin resistance develops when this hormone cannot work properly when blood insulin levels are abnormally high and still relatively ineffective in keeping blood glucose levels .
metabolic specialists now use the term insulin resistance syndrome .
insulin is hormone produced by the pancreas and it is important in the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats .
when sugar and carbohydrates are eaten insulin promotes the uptake of glucose from the blood into muscles and fat cells .
hence it is often said that insulin allows cells to use glucose for energy and also to store excess glucose and sugar as glycogen and fat .
when blood glucose levels fall stored glucose is released for energy from the breakdown of glycogen stores in the liver and in the muscles .
in the metabolic syndrome .
fasting blood levels of insulin in the morning are often abnormally high and insulin levels rise to very high levels when food is eaten .
continuously high levels of insulin cause the liver cells to store fat resulting in fatty liver which cannot function .
as the insulin resistance worsens the pancreas may not be able to produce enough insulin in response to food and then glucose levels in the blood .
so why haven you heard .
well until quite recently the connection between metabolic syndrome and host of chronic diseases .
we now know that insulin resistance .
until recently it was difficult to measure blood insulin levels but the technology has improved and we can now measure blood insulin levels accurately and we have good tests to diagnose insulin resistance as well as good strategies to reverse insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome .
once you can measure insulin resistance you are well on your way to fixing .

all nuts are excellent sources of protein .
an added benefit to nuts is that they help you feel full faster grass fed .
unfortunately beef has gotten bad rap today .
dr axe recommends grass fed beef as an excellent source of protein and healthy fats which can help build muscle and burn calories in the process .
as easy sources of protein .
women health shares that they also help build healthybones chicken .
besides being great source of protein dr axe shares that chicken has the added benefit of satisfying food cravings causing you to stop eating .
according to women health peanut butter is an excellent source of testosterone an essential component in maintaining muscle .
it also helps with burning fat as it builds muscle satiating foods eating fruits and vegetables is great but often leaves you hungry .
knowing what foods help satisfy hunger or make you feel full faster can help curb your appetite apple cider vinegar .
according to dr axe taking one to two tablespoons of vinegar before your meal can help curb your sugar .
besides being an excellent source of protein webmd points out that greek yogurt is extra filling keeping you from eating as much food cinnamon .
cinnamon has many health benefits but big one is curbing the appetite .
webmd recommends putting it in your morning coffee or tea metabolism boosting foods speeding up your metabolism is great way to burn .

no longer do you have to rely on simply counting calories and working out at the gym .
you can make your food work for you .
by being wise with what you eat .
for those unfamiliar ketogenic dieting is any diet plan low carb enough to switch your body into state of producing and burning significant amount of ketones specifically acetoacetate acac and its derivatives beta hydroxybutyrate bhb and acetone .
for those interested in background reading ve previously written summary articles about the science of fat metabolism and ketosis .
these molecules especially acac and bhb are used by the brain .
while the biological processes involved are extremely complex invite you to use this as the beginning of an important conversation for you and your doctor to explore together .
indeed ketogenic dieting may or may not be appropriate for you so please consult with your doctor before experimenting on yourself .
focusing the brain increased memory cognition clarity and seizure control less migraines ketogenic diets were notably first used at the mayo clinic in the to treat .
while the exact mechanism of seizure prevention on ketogenic diet is still mystery researchers believe it has something to do with the increased stability of neurons and up regulation of brain mitochondria and mitochondrial enzymes .
related to this research some serious attention has been given to ketogenic dieting and alzheimers disease .
scientists have discovered increased cognition and enhanced memory in adults with impairments in these areas and growing body of research shows improvement at all stages of dementia .
ketosis has been shown to be effective against parkinson disease .
for broader audience of dieters the often reported side effects of increased mental clarity and focus and less frequent and less intense migraines are likely related to the more stable blood sugar and altered brain chemistry .
fighting some types of cancer dom agostino lab published an article in entitled ketone supplementation decreases tumor cell viability and prolongs survival of mice with metastatic cells express an abnormal metabolism characterized by increased glucose consumption .
previous studies indicate that unlike healthy tissues cancer cells are unable to effectively use ketone bodies .
furthermore ketones inhibit the proliferation and viability of cultured tumor cells .
preventing heart disease lower blood pressure lower triglycerides better cholesterol profiles again related to the downstream effects of keeping blood glucose low and stable ketogenic dieting helps keep blood pressure in check and lowers triglyceride levels .
while it may seem counterintuitive that eating higher percentage of fat in your diet lowers triglycerides it turns out that the consumption of excess carbs especially fructose is the key driver of increasing triglycerides .
and regarding hdl and ldl particles which the body uses to move fat and cholesterol around ketogenic dieting helps raise hdl good cholesterol and improve the profile of ldl bad cholesterol .
improving energy levels and sleep by day or on ketogenic diet most people report an increase in general energy levels and lack of cravings for carbs .
the mechanism here involves both stabilization of insulin levels and readily available source of energy for our brain .
sleep .
studies have shown that ketogenic dieting improves sleep by decreasing rem and increasing slow wave sleep .
while the exact mechanism is unclear it likely is related to the complex biochemical shifts involving the brain use of ketones for energy combined with other body tissues directly burning .
an important caveat is that ketogenic diet temporarily raises uric acid levels especially when dehydrated but over time they come down .
combined with tons of anecdotal evidence over the years there is an entire movement behind bodybuilders using ketogenic approach to gain more muscle and less fat typically muscle gain also comes with fat gain so there understandable attention being given toward preventing .
in addition dr stephen phinney and dr jeff volek have number of papers published about ketogenic dieting for ultra .
in short once these athletes are fully fat adapted there is evidence to suggest that mental and physical performance is significantly improved beyond normal carbohydrate .
and last but not least curbing diabetes obesity and metabolic syndrome .

want to lose weight and melt fat .
unique kit .
bt wdpfua the science behind hcgin the dr .
simeons .
was looking for cure for obesity .
his research on this subject spanned over years mostly from his lab in italy whereby he found what many call the holy grail of weight loss he founded the research that lead to hcg weight loss .
dr simeons found that given the right circumstances people could lose as much as pound of pure fat .
not lean muscle or water weight but fat .
most people thought it crazy to lose pound per day and still be healthy .
it true dr .
over the years other doctors began studying dr simeons unique protocol and taking it back .
most came to the same conclusion which was that people were not just losing pounds and inches but they were able to keep it off using the hcg program .
the answer is in understanding how the body .
the human body has three kinds of fat .
the first is the structural fat which fills the gaps between various organs sort of packing material .
structural fat also performs important functions as bedding the kidneys in soft elastic tissue protecting the coronary arteries and keeping the skin .
it also provides the springy cushion of hard fat under the bones of the feet .
the second type is called the normal fat .
the normal fat reserve is drawn upon when the nutritional income from the intestinal tract is insufficient to meet the demand .
such normal reserves are localized all over the body .
fat is substance which packs the highest caloric value into the smallest space so that normal reserves of fuel for muscular activity and the maintenance of body temperature .
both these types of fat structural and reserve are normal and even if the body stocks them to capacity this can never be called obesity .
the third type of fat is abnormal fat .
it is the accumulation of abnormal fat that is found in people who are obese .
this abnormal fat is also potential reserve of fuel but unlike the normal reserves it is not available to the body in nutritional emergency .
the reason the abnormal fat .
typical dieters will lose normal fat reserves first and then move onto the structural fat .
by the time people get to the point that they can target the abnormal fat they have become too week and too hungry and don quite get there how is hcg fat loss like money if you look at it like money abnormal fat is non liquid asset and reserve fat is like cash or liquid .
your body can use reserve fat immediately on demand .
but abnormal fat sometimes referred to as stubborn fat cannot be accessed on demand .
there is special process that must occur in order for you to access your abnormal fat .
much like the process you must go through to access non liquid assets be it the selling of stocks and bonds or even selling .
in these latter cases your money is tied up and not immediately accessible .
this video presents discussion on ectopic fat depots by three experts in this area dr ulf smith from sweden dr marja riitta taskinen from finland and dr .
dr smith introduces the notion of ectopic fat .
dr taskinen explains that the liver is very central organ because of its importance in the metabolism of triglyceride rich lipoproteins .
an imbalance in lipid metabolism may cause fatty liver and an atherogenic .
moreover she explains that in addition to fat accumulation in the liver and in visceral depots lipids can also accumulate around the heart .
dr jensen recalls that some individuals are able to expand their fat depot and remain healthy while others with the same amount or even less adipose tissue expansion .
in this case when adipose tissue cannot properly store lipids the excess energy ends up in the liver the heart and the muscle cells .
several mechanisms are proposed by dr .
finally the important and positive role that could be played by the exercising skeletal muscle in ectopic fat mobilization .

what is fatty liver common signs of fatty liver is reversible condition wherein large vacuoles of triglyceride fat accumulate in liver cells via the process of steatosis abnormal retention of lipids within cell .
despite having multiple causes fatty liver can be considered single disease that occurs worldwide in those with excessive alcohol intake and the obese with or without effects of insulin resistance .
the condition .
when this process of fat metabolism is disrupted the fat can accumulate in the liver in excessive amounts thus resulting in fatty liver .
it is difficult to distinguish alcoholic fld from nonalcoholic fld and both show microvesicular and macrovesicular fatty changes at different stages .
accumulation of fat may also be accompanied by progressive inflammation of the liver hepatitis called steatohepatitis .
by considering the contribution by alcohol fatty liver may be termed alcoholic steatosis or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld and the more severe forms as alcoholic steatohepatitis part of alcoholic liver disease and non alcoholic steatohepatitis .
fatty liver typically has no associated symptoms .
you may encounter fatigue or vague abdominal .
your liver may turn out to be somewhat enlarged .
be that as it may abundance fat in the liver can cause inflammation .
in the event that your liver winds up noticeably inflamed you may have symptoms for example poor appetite .

diabetes treatment in nadipathy what is diabetes it is the condition that body cannot balance the glucose levels due to lack of energy to pancreas or the body cannot utilize insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis .
it was first known in the th century .
again diabetes is differentiated in to two types diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus .
diabetes mellitus is mainly caused by deficiency of insulin due to either lack of energy in pancreas or any auto immune disease .
while diabetes insipidus is caused by defect in secretion of vasopressin antidiuretic hormone which is secreted from pituitary gland present in hypothalamus .
its function is to reabsorb water from distal tubules in the kidney .
