# Audio to Text

**We suggest running all ipynb files on Colab. And be careful of assigning file paths while running code blocks.**

1. extract_audio.ipynb (Could run locally, and on Colab) - Extract audio from videos. (.mp4->.wav)
2. speech2text_gcp.ipynb (Could only run on Colab) - First upload audio files to GCP, then convert audio to text. (.wav->.txt & .json)
