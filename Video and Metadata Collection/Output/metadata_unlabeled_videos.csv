In this video, I provide a demonstration on taking a blood pressure by first listening to the auscultatory gap. This is an important step because some patients (not all) can have a silent gap that can occur, which cause an inaccurate blood pressure reading.First, you'll want to perform hand hygiene and gather your supplies. Next, have the patient sit down with their arm at heart level and their legs uncrossed. Palpate to find the brachial artery, which is located near the bend of the arm. Once you find the brachial artery, you'll want to estimate the systolic pressure by inflating the cuff until you can no longer feel the brachial artery.The point when you no longer feel the brachial artery will be the estimated systolic pressure number. Once you find that number, you'll deflate the cuff and let the patient rest for 30-60 seconds. Next, you'll inflate the cuff 30 mmHg higher than the estimated systolic pressure number that you got earlier. Once you inflate the cuff to the appropriate point, slowly unscrew the bulb to allow it to fall about 2 mmHg per second, and listen closely for the first sound you hear, which will be your systolic number.Continue to let the needle fall until you hear the last sound of the pulse, which will be your diastolic number.Once you have your reading, you can deflate the cuff, remove it, and wipe it off. Then you will document the blood pressure reading.Notes: https://www.registerednursern.com/how-to-take-blood-pressure-manually-clinical-nursing-skills/Website: https://www.registerednursern.com/More Videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2XMro13dD0&list=UUPyMN8DzkFl2__xnTEiGZ1wNursing Gear: https://teespring.com/stores/registerednursernInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/registerednursern_com/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/RegisteredNurseRNsTwitter: https://twitter.com/NursesRNPopular Playlists:NCLEX Reviews: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQrdx7rRsKfWtwCDmLHyX2UeHofCIcgo0Fluid & Electrolytes: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQrdx7rRsKfWJSZ9pL8L3Q1dzdlxUzeKvNursing Skills: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQrdx7rRsKfUhd_qQYEbp0Eab3uUKhgKb",RegisteredNurseRN,https://www.youtube.com/UCPyMN8DzkFl2__xnTEiGZ1w,1.88 million subscribers

Over time, high blood pressure will damage the walls of your arteries. This damage can lead to life threatening conditions. For example, an artery wall may become weak and form an enlarged area called an aneurysm. The wall may burst, and bleed into the tissue around it. In another example, damage to an artery wall may attract certain substances in your blood, such as cholesterol, fat, and calcium. They may form a buildup called a plaque. As the plaque gets bigger, blood flow in the artery is reduced. Blood cells can stick to the plaque and form solid clumps called clots. Blood clots further reduce, or completely block your blood flow. If this happens in your brain, it can lead to a stroke. If it happens in your heart, it can lead to a heart attack. In another example, damage to the arteries in your kidneys may reduce their ability to work properly. This can lead to kidney disease. In a final example, damage to your arteries makes your heartbeat even harder, which raises your blood pressure even more and can lead to heart failure. If you have questions about high blood pressure or any medications you have been prescribed for it, speak with your doctor. It is important to take your medications as directed and report any side effects you have.",Nucleus Medical Media,https://www.youtube.com/UC85VW73bQLEjs_taFKP7TwQ,5.38 million subscribers

Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure.Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. A reading of    119/79 or lower is normal blood pressure    140/90 or higher is high blood pressure    Between 120 and 139 for the top number, or between 80 and 89 for the bottom number is called prehypertension.

All rights reserved. Voice by: Sue SternSupport us on Patreon and get FREE downloads and other great rewards: patreon.com/AlilaMedicalMedia Baroreflex, or baroreceptor reflex, is one of the mechanisms the body uses to maintain stable blood pressure levels or homeostasis. Baroreflex is a rapid negative feedback loop in which an elevated blood pressure causes heart rate and blood pressure to decrease. Reversely, a decrease in blood pressure leads to an increased heart rate, returning blood pressure to normal levels. The reflex starts with specialized neurons called baroreceptors. These are stretch receptors located in the wall of the aortic arch and carotid sinus. Increased blood pressure stretches the wall of the aorta and carotid arteries causing baroreceptors to fire action potentials at a higher than normal rate. These increased activities are sent via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to the nucleus of the tractus solitarius  the NTS - in the brainstem. In response to increased baroreceptor impulses, the NTS activates the parasympathetic system  the PSNS - and inhibits the sympathetic system  the SNS. As the PSNS and SNS have opposing effects on blood pressures, PSNS activation and SNS inhibition work together in the same direction to maximize blood pressure reduction. Parasympathetic stimulation decreases heart rate by releasing acetylcholine which acts on the pacemaker cells of the SA node. Inhibition of the sympathetic division decreases heart rate, stroke volume and at the same time causes vasodilation of blood vessels. Together, these events rapidly bring DOWN blood pressure levels back to normal. When a person has a sudden drop in blood pressure, for example when standing up, the decreased blood pressure is sensed by baroreceptors as a decrease in tension. Baroreceptors fire at a lower than normal rate and the information is again transmitted to the NTS. The NTS reacts by inhibiting parasympathetic and activating sympathetic activities. The sympathetic system releases norepinephrine which acts on the SA node to increase heart rate; on cardiac myocytes to increase stroke volume and on smooth muscle cells of blood vessels to cause vasoconstriction. Together, these events rapidly bring UP blood pressure levels back to normal. Baroreflex is a short-term response to sudden changes of blood pressure resulted from everyday activities and emotional states. If hypertension or hypotension persists for a long period of time, the baroreceptors will reset to the new normal levels. In hypertensive patients for example, baroreflex mechanism is adjusted to a higher normal pressure and therefore MAINTAINS hypertension rather than suppresses it.",Alila Medical Media,https://www.youtube.com/UCiTGKA9W0G0TL8Hm7Uf_u9A,833K subscribers

The cuff is placed above the antecubital artery and the cuff is above the upper arm. The stethoscope is placed near the antecubital artery and no sound will be hear when there is enough pressure to close off the artery. When the pressure is slowly released, the sound of blood jetting through the vessel by the vibrations of the wall is called the Korotkoff sounds. The first sound is also the systolic pressure. The diastolic pressure is when a muffled quality occurs. Please note that the sound is often overestimated because sound can still be heard even after deflation of the cuff.

It doesn't really exist. But, what I'm finding through a lot of research recently is that Vitamin D3 might be as close as we can get to something that can reduce belly fat as anything that's out there. Let me explain how this works because honestly it's pretty fascinating.What Vitamin D is, first and foremost is a fat soluble Vitamin. It's a fat soluble Vitamin that helps regulate mood, it can help regulate metabolism and most importantly it regulates where calcium goes in the body. But, because it's fat soluble it means that it's stored in the fat cell. Start thinking about this: if you have an excess amount of fat or if you're overweight that means that most of the Vitamin D that you consume, even if you're taking a supplement, is going to get sequestered into those fat cells and it's going to stay there meaning you have less bio actively available Vitamin D3 to do the cool things that I'm about to explain.Let's talk about how Vitamin D3 actually burns fat. The first method is by increasing something called Leptin. Have you ever eaten food before and gotten full? If you haven't you're probably not human. Honestly, what happens is leptin signals your brain that you're full. When you eat a lot of food you have the production of Leptin, signals your brain that you're full and you stop eating. Problem is that without Vitamin D3, Leptin levels don't generally increase that much. If you have enough D3 your brain can signal and your brain can be told you need to stop eating. It's that simple. Low levels of Vitamin D3 those Leptin levels don't get too high and you can keep eating, making it very easy to overeat.Remember what I said about the Vitamin D3 getting stored in fat cells? Think about this, if you already are low in D3 and then you eat and you don't have enough Leptin so you keep eating more then you're going to develop more fat cells, which means you're going to hold onto more Vitamin D in the fat cells and more and more to the point where you have this snowball effect where you continue to store fat. Are you one of those people that have just looked in the mirror and say how did this happen to me?Honestly, I was one of those people seven or eight years ago. The other way that Vitamin D3 is proving to potentially be a good belly fat burner is through the modulation of the parathyroid and calcitriol hormones. The Parathyroid is a small set of glands around the thyroid in our throat and basically when they produce parathyroid or they produce calcitriol, we have a rapid increase in how our body stores fat. It tends to want to store it more. If we have enough Vitamin D3 the parathyroid and calcitriol hormones aren't quite as crazy. They're not going quite as haywire, which means your body slowly stores and slowly metabolizes fat versus doing it rapidly, making it where you look in the mirror and feel like it happened overnight.Those are the two main reasons that Vitamin D3 is starting to play a big role in belly fat. This wouldn't be a traditional video of mine if I didn't at least reference one peer reviewed, double blind placebo study. One study took 218 women. These 218 women they gave a strict diet and exercise program to and they asked them to follow it for a year. Then they took half of these women and they gave them Vitamin D. The other half of the women they gave a placebo. After one year of time, it was found that the women that took the Vitamin D had on average seven pounds more weight loss than those that didn't take the Vitamin D. It doesn't sound like much but just by adding Vitamin D, it's pretty dang interesting.Then, there's one other study. There is another study that found that those that were taking Vitamin D3 had a better waist to hip ration than those that were not.References:1) 10 Reasons to Take Vitamin D to Lose Fat and Build Muscle.

Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.Diabetes refers to a group of conditions characterized by a high level of blood glucose, commonly referred to as blood sugar. Too much sugar in the blood can cause serious, sometimes life-threatening health problems.There are two types of chronic diabetic conditions: type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Pregnant women may acquire a transient form of the disease called gestational diabetes which usually resolves after the birth of baby. Pre-diabetes is when the blood sugar level is at the borderline: higher than normal, but lower than in diabetics. Prediabetes may or may not progress to diabetes.During food digestion, carbohydrates - or carb - break down into glucose which is carried by the bloodstream to various organs of the body. Here, it is either consumed as an energy source - in muscles for example - or is stored for later use in the liver. Insulin is a hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas and is necessary for glucose intake by target cells. In other words, when insulin is deficient, muscle or liver cells are unable to use or store glucose, and as a result, glucose accumulates in the blood. In healthy people, beta cells of the pancreas produce insulin; insulin binds to its receptor on target cells and induces glucose intake. In type 1 diabetes, beta cells of the pancreas are destroyed by the immune system by mistake. The reason why this happens is unclear, but genetic factors are believed to play a major role.  Insulin production is reduced; less insulin binds to its receptor on target cells; less glucose is taken into the cells, more glucose stays in the blood. Type 1 is characterized by early onset, symptoms commonly start suddenly and before the age of 20. Type 1 diabetes is normally managed with insulin injection. Type 1 diabetics are therefore insulin dependent.In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas produces enough insulin but something goes wrong either with receptor binding or insulin signaling inside the target cells. The cells are not responsive to insulin and therefore cannot import glucose; glucose stays in the blood. In other words, type 2 diabetics are insulin resistant.  Here again, genetic factors predispose susceptibility to the disease, but it is believed that lifestyle plays a very important role in type 2. Typically, obesity, inactive lifestyle, and unhealthy diet are associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes. Type 2 is characterized by adult onset; symptoms usually appear gradually and start after the age of 30. Type 2 diabetes accounts for about 80 to 90% of all diabetics. Management focuses on weight loss and includes a low-carb diet.",Alila Medical Media,https://www.youtube.com/UCiTGKA9W0G0TL8Hm7Uf_u9A,833K subscribers

Type 1 Diabetes is a condition in which your pancreas does not produce insulin, a hormone your body needs to maintain proper blood sugar levels. Without insulin, glucose cannot get into your cells, so they are starved for the calories they should be receiving from glucose. In addition, the glucose level builds up in your bloodstream, resulting in a condition called hyperglycemia. If you have Type I diabetes, your goal is to keep your blood glucose within a normal range.  This is done through a combination of proper insulin replacement, monitoring your blood glucose and, just as importantly, eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise.Nucleus Medical Media creates medical and scientific visual content for the healthcare, pharma, and medical device industries.

Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.A1C test is a blood test used to diagnose diabetes and monitor the progress of a treatment plan. The test result reflects the average blood sugar levels in the past 3 months. A1C is a type of glycated hemoglobin - a hemoglobin that is bound to glucose. Hemoglobin is the major protein of red blood cells. A1C forms as a result of interaction between red blood cells and sugar in the blood. The higher the blood glucose levels, the more glucose binds to hemoglobin, the greater the amount of A1C. The A1C blood test reports the percentage of hemoglobin that is bound to glucose.Once a hemoglobin is glycated, it remains that way in the blood, until the red blood cell carrying it is removed from the circulation. Because the average lifespan of a red blood cell is 3 to 4 months, A1C measurement represents the status of blood glucose for the past 3 months or so.A normal blood glucose level corresponds to an A1C result of less than 5.7%. An A1C level higher than 6.5% indicates diabetes. Between 5.7 and 6.5% is prediabetes. An estimated average glucose level, eAG, measured in concentration units, milligrams per deciliter or millimoles per liter, can be calculated and often reported in addition to the A1C percentage. eAG helps patients link A1C to the numbers they obtain at home using a blood sugar measuring device. A1C is an important tool for managing diabetes. For most diabetics, the goal is to bring A1C level down to 7% or less. However, patients age and other health conditions must be taken into account when setting goals. In general, younger patients who dont often experience severe low glucose, known as hypoglycemia, need lower goals to avoid diabetes complications in the many years ahead. Older patients or those having frequent low-glucose episodes, may have a higher goal.It is important to note that several factors can affect the accuracy of A1C test result, in which case, unless corrections can be made, A1C cannot be used to assess blood glucose levels. For example, people with blood disorders such as sickle cell disease, thalassemia, or hemolytic anemia may have a lower than expected A1C because their red blood cells have a shorter lifespan. Iron deficiency anemia, on the other hand, is associated with increased red blood cell lifespan and falsely high A1C measurements. Some people of African, Mediterranean, or Southeast Asian descent may have uncommon forms of hemoglobin that produce falsely high or low results. Certain kidney and liver diseases may affect the turnover rate of red blood cells and give rise to inaccurate A1C readings. Finally, recent blood loss or transfusion will also skew the test results.",Alila Medical Media,https://www.youtube.com/UCiTGKA9W0G0TL8Hm7Uf_u9A,833K subscribers

Is Vitamin B Complex Good or Bad For DiabetesDownload Diabetes Management Book: http://bit.ly/2g0NDAHHello, I'm Ty Mason from TheDiabetesCouncil.com, researcher, writer and I have type 2 diabetes.  Today I'm going to answer the question, is vitamin B complex good for diabetes. But before we get into that, make sure you download my free diabetes management book which also includes a diabetes grocery shopping guide (foods to eat and avoid).Most vitamins, minerals, nutrients, etc we need we can get from foods.  However, in our world of getting things now, many of the foods that house these items are slowly disappearing from the shelves.Because of this many are turning to supplements to do just that, supplement their diet with nutrition lost in the world of high processed foods.When it comes to Vitamin B, we discuss the word complex.  This simply means something with every B vitamin in it. How many B vitamins are there?  Well, there are 8.  Each one has different ways in which they help the body.  Some maintain healthy skin and muscle tone, others enhance your immune and nervous system functions, while still others promote cell growth and division.The eight B vitamins are B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, and B12 - and they all have other names that you're probably more familiar with.  And please dont ask me what happened to Vitamins B4, B8, B10 and B11 because I have no idea.All Bs are water-soluble vitamins.  This means that your body can't store them.  B Vitamins need to be added daily because whatever the body doesn't use, gets flushed out in your urine.Most people get these vitamins in the food they eat. If you have food restrictions, whether you don't eat meat, dairy products, eggs, or whole grains for whatever reason, you may need to take supplements.There are specific B Vitamins that are beneficial to those with diabetes.  B1 (thiamine) helps the body convert carbohydrates and fat into energy.  In foods this is found in whole grains, mainly green veggis and livers.B2 (riboflavin) is required by the body for the metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.  This is found in many dairy products.B6 (Pyridoxine) aids in the protection of nerve cells.  This is especially important to fight diabetic neuropathy.  This is found in nuts, fish, salad greens and bananas.B12 (Cobalamin) is crucial to good blood health.  This is mainly found in animal products.So is B complex good for diabetes?  Yes it is.  If you dont eat a lot of meat or dairy, you especially need to supplement your diet with a good B complex.I hope this answered your question is vitamin B complex good or bad for diabetes. Dont forget to get your diabetes management book.Let me know if you have any other diabetes related questions.",Beat Your Diabetes,https://www.youtube.com/UCU_hf2yPhOgy8KtNGgP5qlg,132K subscribers

PT3M21S,Mko250V6PYI,What is Diabetes Mellitus? - Understanding Diabetes - Diabetes Type 1 and Type 2,115773,2020-10-24,"Free Medical Education, diabetes mellitus, diabetes type 1, diabetes type 2, what is diabetes, Understanding Diabetes",2074,0.0,"What is Diabetes Mellitus?Diabetes mellitus occurs when there is a deficiency in insulin production. This results in high level of blood sugar in the body. Without insulin in our body, glucose cannot enter the body cells and is excreted through urine, which results in its loss. An increase in blood glucose concentration leads to loss of water in cells, via osmosis, to blood.To understand what happens in a diabetes patient, we need to understand what happens in the normal mechanism. Whenever the blood glucose level increases, the pancreas respond by secreting insulin. Insulin has two functions here, it converts glucose to glycogen and increases metabolism of glucose in cells. This is how the glucose level falls and the blood sugar level goes back to normal.When the blood sugar level is low, the pancreas respond by secreting less insulin, which in turn reduces the conversion of glucose to glycogen. The sugar level increases and blood sugar level goes back to normal.Normally after we eat or drink, our body will break down sugars from our food and use them for energy in our cells. To accomplish this, our pancreas needs to produce a hormone called insulin. Insulin is what facilitates the process of pulling sugar from the blood and putting it in the cells for use, or energy.If you have diabetes, your pancreas either produces too little insulin or none at all. The insulin cannot be used effectively. This allows blood glucose levels to rise while the rest of your cells are deprived of the much-needed energy. This can lead to a wide variety of problems affecting nearly every major body system.Types of DiabetesThere are two types of Diabetes Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 is also called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is an immune system disorder. Our own immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, destroying our bodys ability to make insulin. With type 1 diabetes, one must take insulin to live. Most people are diagnosed as a child or young adult as it is inherited.Its symptoms include frequent urination, thirst and fatigue, insulin shock and diabetic coma. Insulin shock can be described as a feeling of dizziness, sweating and paleness. Diabetic coma can be described as partial or complete loss of consciousness.Type 2 is related to insulin resistance. It used to occur in older populations, but now more and more younger populations are being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. A major risk factor of this type of diabetes is obesity. Obese people tend to get this more. Type 2 diabetes is mostly a result of poor lifestyle, dietary, and exercise habits.With type 2 diabetes, our pancreas stops using insulin effectively. This causes issues with being able to pull sugar from the blood and put it into the cells for energy. Eventually, this can lead to the need for insulin medication. Its symptoms include blurred vision and fatigue.How to Support Us?One time Contribution: https://fundrazr.com/FreeMededucationBecome Our Patron and Monthly Supporter: https://www.Patreon.com/FreeMedEducationFollow us:YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/FreeMedEducationFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/FreeMedEducationFacebook Groups: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1162636387091983#FreeMedicalEducation #Diabetes #DiabetesMellitus",FreeMedEducation,https://www.youtube.com/UCTCEJCypL-cwp2EWlT5pmGg,458K subscribers

During digestion, carbohydrates in food are broken down into glucose which is carried by the bloodstream to various organs of the body. Glucose is taken up by the cells and is either consumed as an energy source or stored for later use. Insulin is a hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas and is necessary for driving glucose into cells. Binding of insulin to its receptor on target cells triggers a signaling cascade that brings glucose transporters to the cell membrane. When insulin is deficient, glucose cannot enter the cells; it stays in the blood, causing high blood sugar levels while the cells are deprived of nutrition. This results in unexplained weight loss and increased hunger. As blood sugar level exceeds the ability of the kidneys to reabsorb, it overflows into urine, taking water along with it, resulting in large volumes of urine, dehydration and excessive thirst. In the long run, too much sugar in the blood may cause damages to blood vessels, resulting in increased risks of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke. Damaged vessels in the eyes may lead to loss of vision; while in the kidneys, renal failure may result. High blood sugar is also toxic to the nerves, resulting in numbness, tingling and reduced pain perception. This, together with impaired wound healing can lead to development of skin ulcers, most commonly in the feet. Acute hyperglycemic crises may develop when diabetic patients undergo additional stress such as infections, other illness or inadequate treatment. These complications involve severe disturbances of blood homeostasis and are potentially life-threatening.There are two major types of diabetes mellitus.In type 1, beta cells of the pancreas are destroyed by the bodys own immune system by mistake. The exact mechanism remains unclear, but genetic factors are believed to play a major role, with at least 50 genes involved in predisposition to the disease.  Insulin production is reduced; less insulin binds to its receptor on target cells; less glucose is taken into the cells; more glucose stays in the blood. Type 1 is characterized by early onset, symptoms usually start suddenly, before the age of 20. Type 1 diabetes is insulin dependent and can be successfully managed with insulin replacement. In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas produces enough insulin but something goes wrong either with receptor binding or the signaling cascade in the target cells. The cells are not responsive to insulin and therefore cannot import glucose. Type 2 diabetics are said to be insulin resistant.  Here again, genetic factors predispose susceptibility to the disease, but lifestyle plays a major role. Type 2 is characterized by adult onset; symptoms appear gradually, usually after the age of 30. Management focuses on weight loss and includes a low-carb diet.",0,0,0

Part I,320516,2017-06-06,"McMaster Demystifying Medicine, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, PCOS",2311,0.0,"By residing in a contemporary society where individual appearances are heavily influenced by pop-culture, many women may define their ideal beauty and body type as slim and hairless. However, this definition is problematic as this ideal standard of beauty can only be achieved by a small group of women who have the required biological framework. Often, many women cannot meet these standards due to varying hormonal and dietary issues. PCOS affects over 4-5 million women worldwide and has negative implications on their menstrual cycle, reproductive ability, and metabolic activity (Goodarzi & Azziz, 2006). The aim of the video is to create awareness and educate the public about PCOS and its characteristic traits such as amenorrhea, hirsutism, obesity, and enlarged cystic ovaries (Homburg, 2008). To aid in the explanation and provide a thorough, but appropriate level of detail, the video will have a pathophysiology section explaining how testosterone levels are increased within the body which can lead to an upregulation of the aforementioned symptoms. The video will also explain the risk factors and the common medications used to treat the symptoms. The topic will be explained through a presentation characterized by animations and voice-over narrations. It will elucidate the characteristics of PCOS, and discuss its symptoms, pathophysiology, risk factors, and treatment plans. The main target audience for the video is the general public (high school and older), who may be interested in learning more about PCOS.This video was created by  McMaster University student Nayab Zafar in collaboration with the  McMaster Demystifying Medicine program.Please see: https://youtu.be/BgNpATWfR5Y for Part IICopyright McMaster University 2017References Ehrmann, D.

Vitamin D supplementation has been found to improve fertility, decrease inflammation, and reduce testosterone levels in women living with PCOS. However, there isnt an accepted optimal amount of vitamin D for women with PCOS. Many researchers believe the current recommended amount of vitamin D for the average person is set too low at 600 International Units (IU) daily and should be increased. Women who are deficient in vitamin D need higher amounts of vitamin D than the RDA, typically 2,000 IU to 5,000 IU daily.Any D-3 supplement that is independently tested by an organization like NSP, GMP, or Consumer Labs is a good choice.

But, I think the missing piece that you need to know is that high androgens can be caused by high insulin. And high androgens may cause many of the symptoms of PCOS.Unfortunately, insulin levels are rarely checked. You cant really determine whats going on with insulin by checking your blood sugar levels. You could actually have normal blood sugars and still have high levels of insulin.If youre not sure what causes high insulin, I have a lot of other videos on that topic.

This weeks video is about metformin and the importance of slowly building up your dose to the prescribed dose to help reduce it's side effects when you're first started on it.Metformin is a medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes and sometimes polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Type 2 diabetes is an illness where the body doesn't make enough insulin, or the insulin that it makes doesn't work properly. This can cause high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia). PCOS is a condition that affects how the ovaries work.KEY FACTS: Metformin works by reducing the amount of sugar your liver releases into your blood. It also makes your body respond better to insulin. Insulin is the hormone that controls the level of sugar in your blood. It's best to take metformin with a meal to reduce the side effects. The most common side effects are feeling sick, vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach ache and going off your food. Metformin does not cause weight gain (unlike some other diabetes medicines). Metformin may also be called by the brand names Bolamyn, Diagemet, Glucient, Glucophage, and Metabet.HOW AND WHEN TO TAKE:It's best to take metformin tablets with a meal to reduce the side effects. Swallow your metformin tablets whole with a glass of water. Do not chew them.Metformin tablets come in different strengths. Your doctor will tell you how many tablets to take a day.  DIFFERENT TYPES OF METFORMIN:Metformin comes as 2 different types of tablet - standard-release tablets and slow-release tablets.Standard-release tablets release metformin into your body quickly. You may need to take them several times a day depending on your dose.Slow-release tablets dissolve slowly so you don't have to take them as often.Your doctor or pharmacist will explain what type of metformin tablets you are on and how to take them.Metformin is also available as a liquid for children and people who find it difficult to swallow tablets. Liquid metformin is called by the brand name Riomet.WILL MY DOSE GO UP OR DOWN:Your doctor will check your blood sugar levels regularly and may change your dose of metformin if necessary.When you first start taking metformin standard-release tablets you will be advised to increase the dose slowly. This reduces the chances of getting side effects.(See video for explanation on how to build up dose slowly)If you find you can't tolerate the side effects of standard-release metformin, your doctor may suggest switching to slow-release tablets.HOW TO COPE WITH SIDE EFFECTS: Feeling sick - take metformin with food to reduce the chances of feeling sick - it may also help to slowly increase your dose over several weeks. Diarrhoea or vomiting - have small but frequent sips of water. It may also help to take oral rehydration solutions which you can buy from a pharmacy or supermarket to prevent dehydration. Don't take any other medicines to treat diarrhoea or vomiting without speaking to a pharmacist or doctor.

Timestamps: 0:00 What effects do diabetes medications have on your body? 0:56 There are 3 different effects that certain medications create in this scenario3:00 Metformin increases the sensitivity of your insulin receptorsIn this video, I explain the effects of type 2 diabetes medications on your body. Your pancreas makes the hormone insulin, which travels through your blood. Insulin responds to carbohydrates; less so to protein. Its goal is to lower your blood sugar. Insulin is received by whats called an insulin receptor. As I said, one goal is to lower blood sugar. Another is to store glycogen (sugar), cholesterol, or fat. There are 3 different effects these medications create in this scenario. One is that they increase the production of insulin. One popular medication is called sulfonylurea, but it works only for type 2 diabetes, not type 1. The problem with this medication is that its also used as an herbicide. It increases your risk of cardiovascular disease and death.Another mechanism works on the insulin receptor. People with type 2 diabetes have insulin resistance, meaning their receptors arent taking in insulin very well. This creates a failure in the feedback loop to the body, which ends up getting the message to produce more and more insulin. The more the receptor is resistant, the more insulin the pancreas is going to produce. If youre taking a sulfonylurea, which increases insulin production, your insulin levels are going to get quite high. Metformin increases the sensitivity of your receptors; that is, they can receive more insulin. A black label on metformin warns of the dangers of a condition called lactic acidosis, a serious condition that causes your pH to go way up. A natural remedy for this condition is vitamin B1. The problem is that metformin depletes B1. Many type 2 diabetics are given insulin. The problem is that the pancreas is already producing too much insulin because of insulin resistance. So too much insulin is being dumped into the system for the purpose of lowering blood sugar. And it comes with the risk of cardiovascular disease, weight gain, and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). With hypoglycemia, you become irritable and shaky and want to eat carbs to raise your blood sugar back up, starting the whole cycle over again.Now you can see the effects of diabetes medications on your body.Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio: Dr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

It is the only drug available in this class.Still now its difficult to find a full explanation of the mechanism of action of metformin.However, the primary effect of metformin is to activate the enzyme adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase which is also called AMPK. Metformin activates AMPK enzyme in liver which inhibits the gluconeogenesis. The inhibition of gluconeogenesis leads to decrease glucose production. Patient with type 2 diabetes have considerably less fasting glycemia as well as lower post prandial hyperglycemia after administration of metformin. Also hypoglycemia is rare during metformin therapy. Thats why it is more appropriately termed as euglycemic agent. There are other mechanisms also, like:It increases the insulin sensitivity Increases the fatty acid oxidationDecreases the intestinal glucose absorption Medical disclaimer: Medinaz Academy does not provide medical advice.

And, when to take metformin?Metformin works best when it is used along with a good diet and exercise routine. Although the exact mechanism by which metformin works at molecular-level is not understood completely, researchers believe that metformin helps in reducing blood sugar levels in many ways: Metformin decreases the production of excess glucose in the liver  a process known as gluconeogenesis. Metformin also increases the sensitivity of your body tissues to the insulin produced by your body and helps body cells to use glucose available in your bloodstream more effectively. Now lets talk about - when to take metformin?Metformin is typically taken every day along with or right after a meal.Taking it with a meal helps many people avoid common gastrointestinal side-effects such as nausea.Depending on whether the doctor wants you to take regular release form or the extended-release form, metformin may work for 8 to 12 hours in your body. Therefore, spacing the doses of metformin appropriately is important for minimizing side effects and reaching better blood sugar control.When do you take it?  How has it benefitted you?

Vitamin B1 is naturally water-soluble. Benfotiamine is a fat-soluble B1 vitamin. This is one of the only synthetic vitamins that I like because it has virtually no side-effects.I believe every diabetic should be taking benfotiamine. Vitamin B1 is involved in the engine in the mitochondria that involves glucose metabolism. The more glucose you have running through the machine, the higher the blood sugar, and the more depleted of vitamin B1 youre going to become.With diabetes, there are four main tissues involved, and B1 can help with all of them:1. Nerves/brain - Neuropathy2. Eyes - Retina3. Kidney - Nephron4. Heart vessels - Microvascular endothelial dysfunctionBenfotiamine:  3-5x more absorption  Protects against oxidation and AGEs  Decreases A1C  ProtectionWhen it comes to benfotiamine dosage, consider taking at least 600mg of benfotiamine per day, and you can spread it out. You should also be doing healthy keto and intermittent fasting.Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:Dr. Berg, 56 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

Peripheral neuropathy is a condition where you experience tingling, numbness, or burning-type pain in the bottoms of your feet or your fingertips. The most common cause of peripheral neuropathy is diabetes. High blood sugar can create a lot of inflammation, free radical damage, and destruction to the proteins on the inside of your arteries. This can lead to peripheral neuropathy. However, it can be easy to get relief from this condition. You may want to start consuming a low-carb diet (the healthy keto diet). You also may want to make sure you have very low amounts of omega-6 oils, as well as do intermittent fasting. Potential natural peripheral neuropathy remedies:1. Benfotiamine (4 capsules spread out through the day)2. Alpha-lipoic acid 3.

As the disease progresses, and it  becomes  more  and more advanced, it  becomes difficult to cure peripheral neuropathy, we can palliate  it, but in the early stages. I have many patients who are completely cured of peripheral neuropathy. It is important to identify  what are the  symptoms or  which are the  areas  where  the  peripheral neuropathy is  affecting and what are the causes behind  it as  we  know  nutritional deficiency is one of the primary causes where patients  do come to us   with peripheral neuropathy  it  is  commonly  seen in diabetics,  that is one of the major systemic disease  that can cause peripheral neuropathy, it is also  seen in alcoholics  who have a  constant  habit of drinking  alcohol. So the    complex is because the bacterial flora is destroyed. So the bacterial flora is destroyed. So   absorption of nutrients reduce.  When B complex dips, peripheral neuropathy happens and the other reason can be injuries, whenever there is injury of the nerves that supply the peripheral areas,  then there can be peripheral neuropathy. So correction and treatment of injuries with medicines like arnica is very  helpful. Also we have various other  reason  where the peripheral neuropathy may  happen  like for example  when the weather is  very bad,  cold weather, frost  bite, can cause peripheral neuropathy. Based on the area affected, we can use the right  homeopathic medicine  we can  cure peripheral neuropathy.  For example when bladder is affected and peripheral neuropathy,  then causticum is one of the  major  remedies that are  used. when extremities,  fingers, when  there is  burning of  the palms  and soles, medicines like sulphur, medorrhinum, vipera, crotalus horridus, lacasis, hydrops. These are the medicines used in peripheral neuropathy based in the symptoms that a   physician can rightly identify. If it is due to injury, then arnica, hypericum is very useful in peripheral neuropathy. This is how we can treat and cure. If we can identify the cause and treat using the  medicines treating the  cause,  along  with the constitutional approach, means based on the whole symptoms of the patient, then peripheral neuropathy can be corrected. If diabetes is there, treat  diabetes too   along with  homeopathic medicines for  peripheral neuropathy. So that will tackle the issue.",Doctors' Circle - World's Largest Health Platform,https://www.youtube.com/UCJY1JCVsIgVgN5ePERZ_Upg,1.44 million subscribers

This animation describes the role of the insulin receptor in type 2 diabetes. It focuses on the very recent discovery of how the hormone insulin actually binds to the receptor on the surface of cells, as determined by Professor Mike Lawrence's laboratory at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. Insulin binds to the receptor protein on the cell surface and instructs the cell to take up glucose from the blood for use as an energy source. In type 2 diabetes, we believe that insulin binds to the receptor normally, but the signal is not sent into the cell, the cells do not take up glucose and the resulting high blood glucose levels cause organ damage over time. Understanding how insulin interacts with its receptor is fundamental to the development of novel insulin for the treatment of diabetes.Maja Divjak, 2015",WEHImovies,https://www.youtube.com/UCdBrXvlJn60zgpIQcZ0Fe7w,154K subscribers

We also look at insulin's role in blood sugar levels, and some of the risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes. Transcript (partial)In this video we are going to discuss what blood sugar or blood glucose is, and why it is important.Blood sugar level is the amount of glucose(sugar) present in the blood.  Our body gets glucose from some of the foods we eat.  After the digestive process, the liver releases glucose into the bloodstream, sending it to cells to be used as energy.  As glucose is released into the bloodstream, blood sugar levels rise.  This triggers the pancreas to release the hormone insulin, which tells the cells to open up and let the glucose in, which lowers blood sugar levels. Excess glucose is stored as glycogen in the muscles and liver.  This process happens many times throughout the day after we eat.A normal fasting (no food for 8 hours) blood sugar level is between 70 and 99mg/dl, and a normal level two hours after eating is less than 140mg/dl. So, why is this important?  Well, there are 3 main reasons we need to be aware of our blood sugar level. The 1st reason is that high blood sugar levels can lead to type 2 diabetes.  Type 2 diabetes is when the body doesnt use insulin properly (insulin resistance), or when the pancreas stops producing enough insulin.  Over time, High blood sugar levels can put a lot of stress on the pancreas, possibly causing it to become permanently damaged. 95% of all diabetes cases in the US are type 2.Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop type 2 diabetes and others don't.  However, there are some factors that increase the risk.  -being overweight  the more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin.-fat distribution  more fat storage in the abdomen increases the risk-inactivity - Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin.The 2nd reason we need to monitor our blood sugar levels is that High levels can also lead to atherosclerosis, which is hardening and narrowing of the arteries.  This can block the arteries, putting blood flow at risk, which can lead to other problems.The 3rd reason is low blood sugar levels, this is rare in non-diabetics.  This can be caused by certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, excessive exercise,  and from meals high in refined carbs.Timestamps0:00 Intro0:15 What is blood sugar level?0:30 Example of sugar travelling in the bloodstream1:38 Normal blood sugar level1:57 What is type 2 diabetes?2:34 Risk factors for type 2 diabetes2:55 Blood sugar and Atherosclerosis3:14 Low blood sugar levels3:28 Recommendations",Whats Up Dude,https://www.youtube.com/UCG7WdmLGzacESLc9DMyZb-A,152K subscribers

This is why most of the population is becoming prediabetic or diabetic.Symptoms of prediabetes:  You get tired after you eat  You crave sweets  You're not satisfied after you eat  You can't go many hours without eating, and then when you eat you feel betterYou don't need a lot of glucose (sugar) in your diet to have normal blood sugars. I believe you shouldn't be consuming any sugar at all. If you don't consume sugar, you could clear up so many different health problems.Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio: Dr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

I've also included some really useful tips which I believe everyone should know.  Let me know how you get on with my guide by leaving a comment below. If you have any friends or family who would also benefit from this video then feel free to spread the word. Thanks for watching.BLOOD GLUCOSE TESTING:Blood glucose testing, also known as blood glucose monitoring, is one of the main tools involved in controlling diabetes.Not everyone with diabetes will test their blood glucose levels but it is regarded as being very beneficial for helping to make diet and medication dosing decisions.If you are on any medication that can lead to hypoglycaemia (most notably insulin), you should test your blood glucose levels.WHAT IS A LANCING DEVICE:Lancing devices are used to obtain samples of blood for glucose testing using a lancet.A variety of lancets are on the market, the most common of which are automatic lancing devices (Used in the video).TESTING BLOOD GLUCOSE METER & TESTS STRIPS:Control solutions are used to check that the meter and test strips are working together properly and that the test is performing correctly. Most control solutions last 90 days after opening, please check yours for the actual date. The acceptable range of glucose for that solution is listed on the back of your test strip vial or control solution.USEFUL TIPS:Please watch the full video for all of them but here are some important ones, Use a new lancet every time you use your lancing device. I know it's time consuming but if you don't change, it's going to hurt more and you're at risk of a skin infection. Diabetic patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over time. Its really important that you only ever use one meter to build up a trend of results because different meters will give slightly different results.HOW TO TEST BLOOD GLUCOSE: Prepare your kit for testing. This should include: your meter, test strip, lancing device, cotton wool, monitoring diary and sharps bin. Ensure that the lancing device is primed with a new lancet. Wash and dry your hands - to ensure that the result is not influenced by any sugars that may be present on your fingers. A fuller drop of blood will be obtained if your fingers are warm, so its worth warming your hands by washing with warm water and rubbing them for 10 seconds. Put a test strip into your meter, make sure it switches on and is ready. Prick your finger with the lancing device at the sides of the finger as there are less nerve ending here than at the tips or the pads. Switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skin. You may want to avoid using your little finger due to the skin being thin. If your hands are warmed up you shouldn't need to squeeze your finger for a blood drop, if necessary apply light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Squeezing too hard can interfere with results. Wipe away the first blood drop with clean cotton wool and use the second blood drop for testing (careful not to smear the drop). Gently touch the blood drop with the test strip in the meter, wait a few seconds for result to appear. If the test is successful, clean any blood off your finger  with the cotton wool if necessary. Record the result/details in a monitoring diary. Dispose of the test strip and ensure that the lancet used is put into a sharps bin.If you have any further questions please speak to your pharmacist.Want to see more videos about everything health and pharmacy?

This could be why.Timestamps0:00 High blood sugar levels0:10 Where is the sugar coming from?1:09 Insulin resistance1:56 What to do for insulin resistanceDo you have high blood sugar levels even though youre not consuming dietary sugar? Today were going to talk about why this could be happening.In this situation, the sugar is actually coming from your liver and kidneys. There is something called gluconeogenesis, which is the formation of new sugar. Your body always needs a very small amount of sugar, but your body can make this sugar out of non-carbohydrate sources. It can make it out of fat, protein, and even ketones. Insulin controls this process. Its supposed to turn off gluconeogenesis.When you have high blood sugar, but youre not consuming any sugar, this could mean that you have very low amounts of insulin in your body. Your insulin may actually be too low. Insulin resistance is a condition that can cause you to not have enough insulin.With insulin resistance, you have high levels of insulin, but that insulin is not working in the body, and its not shutting down gluconeogenesis. It may be best to focus on improving insulin resistance.How to help improve insulin resistance:  Exercise more  Increase your fasting  Increase your fiber (vegetable fiber)  Apple cider vinegar  Vitamin D  Chromium  Zinc  B vitamins (nutritional yeast)  Potassium  Magnesium  Get more sleep  Decrease inflammation  Give it more time  Focus on other improvementsDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:Dr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

For more info on health-related topics, go here: https://bit.ly/37j6uCpTake Dr. Berg's Free Keto Mini-Course: http://pxlme.me/-i717vtYDr. Berg talks about the physiology of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) on your brain. The brain can run on glucose and ketones (and also lactic acid). The brain does not store sugar as glycogen like the liver and the muscles, so when you let your blood sugars drop too fast, it can starve the brain cells causing low oxygen. The low oxygen then destroys the neurons and brain cells. If this occurs chronically over time, you can get brain degeneration. There is a counter-regulatory mechanism that helps to bring the sugars back up. Your adrenals pump out adrenaline, and even cortisol to release sugar from other places, in attempts to stabilize the sugar. Growth hormone also kicks in and releases sugar too but will suppress the output of insulin, which is usually driving down the sugars in the first place.. Glucagon also kicks in and does the same. If your adrenals are weak, then it's hormones don't efficiently counter low blood sugars. Also, the deeper cause of hypoglycemia is high insulin and hyperinsulinemia blocks the ability to make glucose in your liver - called glyconeogenesis.

We are caring people, inspiring health.The numbers are surely attention getting: nearly 7 million Americans have undiagnosed diabetes. What gets less notice are the early warning signs. ""If they're not going to their doctor, if they're not seeing their physician they're not having those lab works, they're not reporting their signs they could just be going along with their normal daily activities,"" says Melanie Aracri, a certified diabetes educator for Lee Health. All too often patients show up at a hospital in a health crisis and find out they have highly elevated blood sugar. New studies find 1 in 10 heart attack patients may have undetected diabetes. We've broken down 5 warnings signs that should get your attention.""The three classic signs of high blood sugar, we call them the three ""P""s:  polyphagia, polydipsia, and polyuria. Those are increased thirst, increased hunger, and increased urination,"" says Aracri. It's easy to minimize increased thirst, especially when it's hot. And frequent urination seems to naturally follow. But experts say it could be our body's way of flushing extra glucose.""The kidney has to work really hard to get that blood sugar out, that blood glucose out when it's high,"" says Aracri. Wounds that don't heal could be another warning sign.""The body's not able to fight that infection because of that extra glucose in the system,"" says Aracri. Frequent yeast or urinary tract infections may also be a red flag many people fail to consider. The earlier diabetes is picked up, the easier it is to avoid complications.""it's a learning how to adapt your eating pattern, your meal plan to your lifelong activities and daily habits,"" says Aracri.",Lee Health,https://www.youtube.com/UC49JYhKBzUidtsDzG-SmFEA,150K subscribers

Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. With type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, the more common type, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood. You can also have prediabetes. This means that your blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Having prediabetes puts you at a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes.Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious problems. It can damage your eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. Pregnant women can also get diabetes, called gestational diabetes.A blood test can show if you have diabetes. Exercise, weight control and sticking to your meal plan can help control your diabetes. You should also monitor your glucose level and take medicine if prescribed.NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ",Rehealthify,https://www.youtube.com/UCB5a4eG55pmif3c2OXodIYw,81.8K subscribers

This is VERY common because vitamin B1 (thiamine) is involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates and glucose. In fact, being a diabetic, pre-diabetic, hypoglycemic person can deplete B1 even more increasing the need for B1. B1 supports the myelin (around nerves), the endothelial layer (arteries), the retina to help your vision not to mention your kidneys. It can also effect your autonomic nervous system (sweating palms, ADD, the flight or fight system, high histamines, increase pulse rate, skin allergies, etc.)B1 deficiencies can come from:1.

Understanding these prediabetes symptoms and why they occur could change everything.Timestamps0:04 Pre-symptoms of diabetes1:38 What happens before prediabetes2:27 Insulin resistance3:38 What to doIn this video, were going to talk about the pre-symptoms of diabetes.Prediabetes symptoms:1. Darkened skin (in the body folds)2. Poor memory3. Tired after eating4. Belly fat5. Hunger and cravings6. Slow healing7. Urination at night/increased thirst8. Dry mouth9. Itchy10. Blurred visionThe thing is, you could have all of these symptoms, and your blood sugar levels may still not be high. This is because, way before you get diabetes or even prediabetes, you have high insulin. You probably have high insulin from consuming a high-carb diet and eating too frequently.Too much insulin is toxic, so you will develop insulin resistance. This can go on for years until you eventually develop prediabetes and then diabetes.This can be an easy problem to solve if you understand that all of these symptoms are really side effects of too much insulin and too much blood sugar. In my opinion, the obvious thing to do to help with this situation would be to cut down on the carbohydrates in the diet.Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:Dr. Berg, 56 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

Normal blood glucose levels should be between 60 to 140 mg/dl in order to supply cells of the body with its required energy. Euglycemia, or blood glucose within the normal range, is naturally ideal for the bodys proper functioning. A good balance between hormones of the pancreas, including insulin and glucagon, intestinal and adrenal hormones is required to maintain normal blood glucose levels. Cells can also use proteins and fats in order to produce energy. However, glucose is the major energy source in our body. Glucose is absorbed through the intestines in to the blood stream and then stored by the body in the form of glycogen within the liver and muscle tissue. Regulation of blood glucose is largely done through the pancreatic hormones. Insulin, and glucagon are the two most important ones. Each of these hormones have opposite actions. Insulin, secreted by the pancreatic beta cells, lowers the blood glucose levels. Whereas glucagon, secreted by the pancreatic alpha cells, increases the blood glucose levels. Insulin decreases blood glucose levels by the following mechanisms. Insulin promotes glucose uptake by the cells, especially in the muscle and fat tissue. It also reduces the production of new glucose by the liver. In addition, insulin promotes glycogen production in the liver, using glucose. Through these mechanisms, insulin reduces the blood glucose level to a normal after a meal. On the other hand, glucagon has the opposite of these actions. And its main job is to maintain a healthy blood glucose level between meals. Hypoglycemia, also known as low blood sugar, is a clinical situation characterized by a reduction in plasma glucose concentration to a level that is far below the normal. The glucose level at which an individual becomes symptomatic is highly variable, although a plasma glucose level less than 50 mg/dl is generally considered the threshold. Causes of hypoglycemia are varied, but it is seen most often in diabetic patients. Hypoglycemia may result from medication changes or overdoses, infection, diet changes, metabolic changes over time, or activity changes. Other causes include gastro-intestinal problems, fasting, insulin secreting tumors, endocrine problems, and liver disease. Some common medications that can cause hypoglycemia include, oral hypoglycemics such as phenylbutazone, insulin, propranolol, clofibrate, sulfonamides, isoniazid, methanol, methotrexate, tricyclic antidepressants, thiazide diuretics etc. Early signs of hypoglycemia may include the following.  Heavy sweating. Dizziness. Extreme hunger. Fatigue. And a fast and pounding heartbeat, also known as palpitations. As hypoglycemia worsens, signs and symptoms may include the following. Confusion. Abnormal behavior. Visual disturbances such as blurred vision. Seizures. And loss of consciousness. Medications that are used in the treatment of hypoglycemia include the following. Glucose supplements such as dextrose. Glucose elevating agents such as glucagon. And insulin secretion inhibitors such as diazoxide and octreotide. Ok. That is about hypoglycemia in a nutshell.

In this video, were going to talk about the most common cause of hypoglycemia. Common symptoms of hypoglycemia include: Dizziness Cravings Lightheadedness Sweating Lethargy Irritability If youre diabetic, blood sugar levels below 70mg/dl are considered hypoglycemia. If youre not a diabetic, blood sugar levels below 50mg/dl are considered hypoglycemia.There are many types of hypoglycemia.  Idiopathic hypoglycemic: unknown cause Idiopathic postprandial hypoglycemic: symptoms of hypoglycemia without low blood sugars Adrenal-related hypoglycemia: hypoglycemia due to abnormal adrenal function Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia: related to high insulinHyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is the most common form of hypoglycemia. Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia may be caused by: Insulin injections Tumors Autoimmune disease Drugs Genetics However, the most common cause of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is really excessive carbohydrate consumption, which causes inulin resistance. High carbs will boost your blood glucose, which will trigger a huge spike in insulin.Over time, your body tries to protect itself from insulin by developing insulin resistance. This is where the insulin receptors in your cells become resistant to insulin molecules. In turn, your insulin level rises even more. This cycle continues until you stop spiking your insulin with carbohydrates. Eventually, your pancreas will wear out and produce far less insulin, which causes high blood sugar, which turns into pre-diabetes and diabetes.

Hypoglycemia is a condition where you have low sugar in the blood.A few symptoms of hypoglycemia:  Dizziness  Irritability  Increased thirst  Sugar cravings  DepressionHaving either low or high sugar in the body is not good for your health. Too much sugar in the body basically causes a reverse effect and is called hyperglycemia.Adrenal stress can also cause hypoglycemia. But, there's a big confusion on the deeper cause of hypoglycemia. If someone consumes excess sugars, it creates a whiplash effect of the pancreas pumping out the insulin. This over-reaction will create a drop in blood sugar. Its my opinion that you should avoid sugar, and never add sugar when you have low sugar unless you want to continue this problem.Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:Dr. Berg, 56 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

When you have hypoglycemia, your adrenals compensate to rise in sugar but ALSO your liver. Your brain is the number one target for symptoms from hypoglycemia. If you have liver scar tissue as in cirrhosis or a fatty liver, this can lessen the function of the liver.The liver normally makes glycogen, which is stored sugar and releases it between meals to stabilize low blood sugar, and having damaged liver can lessen this function causing more low blood sugar problems. Your liver also makes a hormone called Insulin-Like Growth Factor (IGF-1), which mobilizes the fat and stored sugar for energy, when you are not eating. Again, if you have a damaged liver, you can suffer the symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). To remedy this, it's vital you consume enough VEGETABLES.Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio: Dr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

With hypoglycemia, what happens, is when the blood sugar goes up, insulin pushes it down, leaving you with low blood sugar. People with low blood sugar typically have a higher amount of insulin pushing blood sugar down, and there are no counter hormones to push the blood sugar back up. Hypoglycemia symptoms:  Fatigue   Dizziness   Irritableness  Grouchiness  Dry eyes  DepressionSome people have this idea that the fuel that the body uses is either glucose, fat, or ketones. But, protein can be used as fuel too. Protein can be converted into glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis. Protein can act as a fuel in addition to replacing the protein in your body. This is why when you consume protein when you have low blood sugar, you start feeling better.If you have hypoglycemia and you were to consume carbohydrates, you might feel better for a minute, but then the insulin will kick the blood sugar back down. When you consume protein, you will stimulate some insulin, but at the same time, you will stimulate glucagon. Glucagon is the opposing hormone to insulin. Glucagon will raise the blood sugar, and insulin will lower it, creating a leveling effect. I actually recommend a moderate amount of protein. I believe what may be best for those with hypoglycemia is to get on the healthy ketogenic diet combined with intermittent fasting.Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:Dr. Berg, 56 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

Diabetes refers to high levels of blood glucose, commonly known as blood sugar. Glucose is the major energy source of the body. It comes from digestion of carbohydrates and is carried by the bloodstream to the bodys cells. But glucose cannot enter the cells on its own; to do so, it requires assistance from a hormone produced by the pancreas called insulin. Insulin induces the cells to take up glucose, thereby removing it from the blood. Diabetes happens when insulin is either deficient or not used effectively. Without insulin, glucose cannot enter the cells; it stays in the blood, causing high blood sugar levels.During pregnancy, a temporary organ develops to connect the mother and the fetus, called the placenta. The placenta supplies the fetus with nutrients and oxygen, as well as produces a number of hormones that work to maintain pregnancy. Some of these hormones impair the action of insulin, making it less effective. This insulin-counteracting effect usually begins at about 20 to 24 weeks of pregnancy. The effect intensifies as the placenta grows larger, and becomes most prominent in the last couple of months. Usually, the pancreas is able to adjust by producing more insulin, but in some cases, the amount of placental hormones may become too overwhelming for the pancreas to compensate, and gestational diabetes results. Any woman can develop gestational diabetes, but those who are overweight or have family or personal history of diabetes or prediabetes are at higher risks. Other risk factors include age, and having previously given birth to large babies.While gestational diabetes usually resolves on its own after delivery, complications may arise if the condition is severe and/or poorly managed.Because of the constant high glucose levels in the mothers blood, the fetus may receive too much nutrients and grow too large, complicating the birth process, and a C-section may be needed for delivery. High levels of glucose also stimulate the babys pancreas to produce more insulin than usual. Shortly after delivery, as the baby continues to have high insulin levels but no longer receives sugar from the mother, the babys blood sugar levels can drop suddenly and become exceedingly low, causing seizures. The newborns blood sugar level must therefore be monitored and corrected with prompt feeding, or if necessary, with intravenous glucose. High blood sugar may also increase the mothers blood pressure and risks of preterm birth. Future diabetes in both mother and child is also more likely to occur. Gestational diabetes can be successfully managed, or even prevented, with healthy diets, physical exercise, and by keeping a healthy weight before and during pregnancy. In some cases, however, medication or insulin injection may be needed.",Alila Medical Media,https://www.youtube.com/UCiTGKA9W0G0TL8Hm7Uf_u9A,837K subscribers

Our second Curious Parents video looks at Gestational Diabetes, a condition that affects up to 12% of pregnancies in Ireland. When you have gestational diabetes, your pancreas is not able to produce enough insulin to help convert sugar into energy. As a result, too much sugar is left in the blood, and left unchecked, this can have serious short term and long term effects for mum and baby.

PT2M36S,xRyYAvhpeMk,"If I have gestational diabetes, how might it affect my baby, and will he be bigger than average?",29241,2013-01-25,"09 If I have gestational diabetes, is it true my baby will be bigger than average",138,0.0,"Moms with diabetes, whether it be Type I, Type II, or gestational diabetes are more likely to cook large babies.  It's because if your blood sugars aren't well controlled during your pregnancy you have a large amount of blood sugar circulating and this is getting to the baby as well.  So they can grow extra large from having that extra sugar.  It causes complications after delivery because their body is normal; they are producing insulin which is like a key that unlocks cells to put the blood sugar into the cell.  Their body's response to this large amount of sugar is to produce a lot of insulin.  This is great and what their body should do while they're inside of you.  But once they're born and not getting all of that sugar, they still have a high level of insulin to compensate for that and it causes their blood sugar to rapidly drop.  A lot of babies born to mothers with diabetes struggle with their own blood sugar after delivery.  So the people who are taking care of your newborn will likely be in tune with this and be watching your newborn for signs of complications.  But as for how big your baby is likely to be, who knows?  It's hard to say.  The chances of your baby being large are reduced by you controlling your blood sugars well during the pregnancy.  So if your doctor has recommended a certain diet make sure you follow that and if your doctor has recommended medication to control your blood sugars, make sure you're taking that as prescribed and checking your blood sugars as frequently as your doctor has suggested as well.  It's likely that in your third trimester you'll go to see some specialists that will watch you and the baby for signs of complications from diabetes.  Usually your doctor will have you go to a specialist called a perinatologist to make sure that your baby is growing well and that the pregnancy overall is going well.  They'll probably also have you talk with diabetic educators that will have you keep a log of your blood sugars and have you come in and discuss any complications or issues you're having with them.  Your doctor is also likely to have you get frequent non-stress tests where you come in and they put your baby on the monitor, meaning they watch your baby's heart rate and your contraction pattern, for a short period of time to make sure your baby has enough oxygen and is doing well.  If you have any other specific questions about your condition or about the things I've mentioned be sure to talk to your doctor and ask how they apply to you.  But if you have any other questions for me feel free to ask them on our Facebook page and recommend us to your friends and family too.",IntermountainMoms,https://www.youtube.com/UC8bmJhVtkIIP_9I1-F6R1Cg,202K subscribers

During gastric bypass, a small pouch is cut out of the stomach, and the small intestine is rerouted to this pouch. This tends to be a quicker, more aggressive weight-loss option. Unlike the Lap Band, it is neither adjustable, nor reversible. This type of surgery typically involves a about a two-night hospital stay. Although most of the stomach and the upper part of the small intestine no longer have food traveling through them, they still produce important digestive juices that are emptied into the small intestine and help with digestion. Most people who have gastric bypass experience a significant reduction in excess weight within the first 18 months after surgery.For more information visit: www.mhs.net/weightlossThis video shows selected portions of surgery that did not have complications.

Stomach contents thus exit more slowly into the duodenum of the digestive tract. This can result in irregular absorption of nutrients, inadequate nutrition, and poor glycemic control.[2][3]Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, feeling full soon after beginning to eat (early satiety), abdominal bloating, and heartburn. The most common known mechanism is autonomic neuropathy of the nerve which innervates the stomach: the vagus nerve. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus is a major cause of this nerve damage; other causes include post-infectious and trauma to the vagus nerve.Diagnosis is via one or more of the following: barium swallow X-ray, barium beefsteak meal, radioisotope gastric-emptying scan, gastric manometry, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Complications include malnutrition, fatigue, weight loss, vitamin deficiencies, intestinal obstruction due to bezoars, and small intestine bacterial overgrowth.Treatment includes dietary modifications, medications to stimulate gastric emptying, medications to reduce vomiting, and surgical approaches.[4]",Medical Centric,https://www.youtube.com/UC-_aWEhUBpH86D1VR0OhVrw,178K subscribers

In this case, we do whats called a gastric emptying study to see how quickly food leaves the stomach or how long it stays in there. Once the diagnosis is made, then we need to go about treating it. One of the first modalities we use to treat gastroparesis, especially if youre a diabetic, is to get a patients blood sugar under tight control because poorly controlled blood sugar results in increased and worse symptoms of gastroparesis. Additionally, we enact lifestyle changes. We have the patient eat small, frequent, low-volume, low-fat and low-fiber meals because high-fiber and high-fat meals tend to be hard to digest, and that impairs the emptying of the stomach. Additionally, we can put the patients on a handful of different medications that we use to try to improve the rate of gastric emptying and improve their symptoms.

Long term exercise programs can reduce blood pressure modestly.Relief of obesity is another advantage which also leads to an improved insulin sensitivity. Generalized inflammatory state also improves with regular exercise training, mediated through decreased adiposity as adipocytes are proinflammatory.Important psychological benefits of exercise include improvement in stress and depression. Social support is better with exercise programs.Regular exercise reduces platelet adhesiveness, improves fibrinolysis and reduces fibrinogen levels and blood viscosity. All these have favourable effect against thrombosis.Salutary effects on arrhythmia include reduced resting heart rate, improved vagal tone, decreased sympathetic activity and  effect on heart rate variability. All these are beneficial in reducing life threatening arrhythmic events in those with established heart disease.Long term exercise programs reduce myocardial oxygen demand, though acutely exercise increases myocardial oxygen demand.

Learn about small steps for healthy eating to help you manage your weight.For more information, visit https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/diet-eating-physical-activity---Transcript:For people living with diabetes and for those trying to prevent Type 2 Diabetes healthy eating is important for controlling blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol. It's also really critical for losing and maintaining a healthy weight.When you have diabetes, your family members can eat the same food that you're eating and benefit from it because they are at higher risk for developing Type 2 Diabetes themselves.Maintaining a healthy weight for a person living with diabetes is critical to manage blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, and to prevent complications such as heart disease and stroke. A target blood sugar range for a person living with diabetes would be 70 to 130 before meals and 180 two hours after a meal.But the best thing is to check with your healthcare team about a target range that's good foryou. For a person who is trying to control their blood sugars, carbohydrates that they eat have the biggest impact on the blood sugar. So knowing how many carbs you're eating helps you keep your blood sugar in a good range. Carbohydrates are found in fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy products -- more places than you expect. A dietician can really help you count carbohydrates and find the foods that contain them.Since so many foods contain carbohydrates and you're trying to get the number down to a level that helps your blood sugar, a dietician will help you balance all of that.Eating a healthier diet actually makes you feel much better in addition to having better blood sugars. For a person living with diabetes or trying to prevent diabetes and maintain a healthyweight, these foods can really help: lean sources of protein like chicken or fish; whole grain foods -- crackers, cereal; vegetables, especially those that grow above the ground and the kind you put insalads; eating whole fruits in place of drinking juices and using low-fat and non-fat dairy products like milk and yogurt. If making big changes in the way you eat seems overwhelming, think about small steps and try to find a quick win.One thing you can do to help you control your portions is you eat using a nine-inch plate. If you divide that plate in half and fill it with vegetables and fruits that leaves you room on the other half for a quarter of the plate to be meat, probably about the size of a deck of cards or three ounces and a quarter of the plate to be starch, grains, or potatoes or bread. Try to eat your meals and snacks at the same time each day and that way you won't get too hungry at any one time which could lead to overeating.Take time when you're eating. Chew your food slowly and enjoy it. Give your brain a chance to know that your stomach is full.When it comes to seasoning your food use herbs and spices. Leave the salt and butter on the side.Make a list when you go shopping and stick with it. Don't go shopping when you're hungry becausethat can lead you to some poor choices. Bring your lunch to work instead of eating out. This will help you control your portions and avoid overeating like you would in a restaurant.When you're cooking at home, wrap up and put away your leftovers promptly. This way you won't be tempted to go back for seconds. And think about stir-fries; they're a great way for you to boost your vegetables and cut back on meat, plus they actually make very good leftovers.[music]People fall off-track all the time when they try and eat a healthier diet. It's normal. Don't get upset about it. Just try to get back on-track soon after you fall off so you don't get totally derailed.It's normal to get discouraged periodically. Think about talking to a dietician. They can help you tailor these diet recommendations to fit your needs and come up with a plan that's easier for you to follow. For a person living with diabetes there are no special foods you need to buy.There are no foods you need to avoid entirely. With portion control and meal planning, evenwith diabetes, you can really enjoy eating.[music]",0,0,0

Complex carbohydrates like whole grains take longer to digest while simple carbs like white flour and refined sugar may cause sudden spikes in your blood sugar levels.Indian foods are deeply rooted in history and are probably one of the oldest foods known to mankind.

We are caring people, inspiring health. Its a growing health concern. Studies show more than three million people are living with type 2 diabetes. Teresa Spano, a naturopathic consultant with Lee Health, says what you eat, when you eat, and how you feel after you eat, can all help determine if youre living with pre-diabetes. Pre-diabetes is more referring to when your fasting glucose levels are going up, usually you can see the hemoglobin A1C that is starting to climb, its not necessarily in the diabetic range but its getting there.Discussing a patients sleep patterns, exercise, and diet can help determine if theyre at risk for developing diabetes. There is a lot of gray area in between completely normal and actually being diabetic, which is where the pre-diabetic range is really where you can help people so much before they actually get to full blown diabetes, said Spano. Health experts may also use the waist to hip ratio to determine if patients are at risk. This ratio look at how the patient is carrying their weight: in their belly or in their hips and thighs? If patients have more belly fat, they are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.  A lot of people just dont really know that they are creeping up towards that, which is probably the scariest thing about it, said Spano. Experts encourage healthy diets of fruit, vegetables, and fiber, and limiting animal protein. Exercise is so important when it comes to preventing diabetes. Sleep is always important as well, stress reduction. Its really the core for everything you hear for staying healthy, said Spano. A blood test to check a patients A1C, triglyceride levels, and cholesterol can ultimately decide if a patient is at risk for type 2 diabetes.",Lee Health,https://www.youtube.com/UC49JYhKBzUidtsDzG-SmFEA,150K subscribers

Lets say youre doing keto and intermittent fasting, but youre blood sugars are higher in the morning. Why is that?Well, if your carbs are less than 10g per day, you may need to lower your carbs. But, if youre hardly consuming any carbs, this could be because your insulin resistance is so severe your insulin cant handle even a small amount of carbs.The insulin could be dysfunctional because the cells that make insulin are not fully there. You dont have enough beta cells in the pancreas to produce the insulin necessary to keep the blood sugars in check.There are four things you could do. All of these things target and support the beta cells of the pancreas.What you could do:1. Berberine2. Beef pancreas (Ancestral)3. Milk thistle4.

Heres what you need to know.Timestamps0:20 Gluconeogenesis0:50 Why does this happen?1:20 The dawn phenomenon1:40 Insulin2:15 Blood sugar3:18 What you can doToday were going to talk about why you might have high blood sugar in the morning even though youve had zero sugar. You might even have your first meal and notice that your blood sugar levels actually go down. Whats up with that?Your liver is actually whats making the sugar. The name for this is called gluconeogenesis. The liver is making new sugar out of protein, ketones, or fat.Everyone has a little bit of this going on. To an extent, this is a normal reaction due to hormone fluctuations. To a very small degree, youll have blood sugar fluctuations throughout the night and throughout the day. But, when you have too much of this, its called the dawn phenomenon.The dawn phenomenon is a situation where you wake up, and your blood sugars are too high. This is likely due to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance makes the dawn phenomenon a lot worse.All of this goes back to insulin, which stores fat, and is supposed to keep gluconeogenesis from happening. When you have insulin resistance, in certain parts of your body, you dont have enough insulin. But, in other parts of the body, you have too much insulin.A normal blood sugar level is about 80. This would mean you have about 1 level teaspoon of sugar in all of your blood or 5 grams. For every 10 points that your blood sugar goes up, thats an increase of 1/2 gram. If your blood sugar is 120 in the morning, this means you have an extra 2 grams of sugar in all of your blood. This is not an outrageous amount that will cause a lot of problems.What you can do if you have high blood sugar in the morning:1. Give it time2. Take things to speed up the process (potassium, magnesium, zinc, and vitamin B12)3.

What most people dont know is that high blood sugar levels can cause severe damage. Whether youre diabetic or not, high blood sugar can cause damage to your nerves, organs and blood vessels. The real danger though is when your blood sugar level does not go down. Its when it doesnt go down where serious health problems can occur.One of the reasons why people suffer from high blood sugar is because they are uneducated about the seriousness of it and the signs that our body gives. Reducing your sugar consumption is one of the most important health tips that you should listen to. Weight loss is just one of the many benefits of lowering your sugar intake.#BloodSugar #HighBloodSugar #BloodSugarLevelsTimestamps:Intro - 0:00Constantly Thirsty 0:58Increased Eating Habits 1:20Constant Urination 1:54Chronic Fatigue 2:22Blurry Vision 2:45Dry Skin 3:07Impotence 3:29Weight Gain 3:44Music:https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/musicSummary:- The main reason why high blood sugar causes you to be thirsty is polyuria. When your blood sugar level is high, your kidneys cannot keep up. So they produce more urine to get rid of the excess glucose they cannot absorb. This causes you to become dehydrated, according to WebMD.- If you find that your eating habits are increasing, you might have high blood sugar levels, according to the Mayo Clinic. The reason why high blood sugar levels can cause increased eating is that glucose is unable to enter the cells. It could be because of lack of insulin or possibly insulin resistance. When this happens, your body is unable to convert the food you eat into energy. So if your body feels it doesnt have enough energy, it will require more food to try and produce glucose.- This sign is directly linked to constant thirst, according to the Mayo Clinic. Your kidneys are unable to keep up with the excess sugar, so they only way they can get rid of it is through urination. Keep an eye on your trips to the bathroom. If you find you are going every hour, you could have high blood sugar levels. But this could also mean you have a more serious health issue. The best advice is to go talk to your doctor.- You might think that having high blood sugar means you have a lot of energy. The total opposite can happen though. When you have high blood sugar, you urinate more and you become thirsty because your kidneys cannot absorb the glucose and create energy, says WebMD.  With no energy, your body will become weak and tired.- When you have high blood sugar, it can cause the lenses of your eyes to swell, WebMD. Anyone that has had swollen lenses knows that it causes your vision to become blurry. In most cases, this is just temporary, but consult a doctor to get a proper diagnosis.- If you experience this sign, your blood sugar levels may have been high for quite some time. High blood sugar levels can cause the nerves to become damaged and also causes the body to lose fluids rapidly, explains WebMD. If this process continues for years, the bodys nerves become damaged and the skin becomes dry.- For men, when it comes to performance in the bedroom, they rely on proper blood flow, according to WebMD.  High blood sugar disrupts that blood flow and even damages the nerves and blood vessels.- If you have high blood sugar, chances are you might be insulin resistant. In this case, your cells no longer respond to insulin. It is extremely difficult for insulin-resistant cells to take glucose from your blood. Because of this, your blood sugar levels begin to build up over time. This can cause you to gain weight, according to Livestrong.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Subscribe to Bestie : https://goo.gl/tUqro6----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Medical Disclaimer: https://pastebin.com/xLmigD6i",0,0,0

It's free and very enlightening. Dr. Berg talks about why diabetics tend to get higher blood pressure. This is because they have higher amounts of insulin. So insulin is not working in the cell, and the body makes more (5-7 more). Insulin causes the retention of sodium. This then causes the retention of fluid, which then raises the blood pressure.Most people then cut out the salt but they do not fix the high insulin. This creates a sodium deficiency. Sodium is needed to prevent muscle and nerve weakness. Side effects include muscle weakness, fatigue and even cramping.To top it off - people take a diuretic, which has a side-effect of causing potassium loss, which worsens the sodium-potassium ratio. Also it has a side-effect of causing insulin resistance, which worsens things.KETO:https://bit.ly/2JbISDoINTERMITTENT FASTING:https://bit.ly/2yxcwPxDr. Eric Berg DC Bio:Dr. Berg, 56 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in weight loss through nutritional and natural methods.

Here are 9 reasons why your blood sugar is high:1. Cortisol - At around 8am, you may have a cortisol spike that is causing high blood sugars.2. Low blood sugar - Your bodys hormones may overcompensate for low blood sugar and cause high blood sugar.3. Late-night snacks - Snacks, especially ones full of carbs, can boost your blood sugar.4. Sugar the day before - Even sugar from the day before can significantly boost your blood sugar 24 hours later.5. Low blood pressure - Blood pressure medications can activate cortisol and raise your blood glucose levels.6. Stress - trauma, stress, and anxiety can raise your cortisol and lead to high blood sugar.7. Forgot to take meds - If you happened to forget your prescribed medications (even for just one day), this could throw off your blood sugar levels.8. Exercise the night before - If you exercised the night before, you could burn up all your sugar, which causes your body to overcompensate (see #2)9. Hidden additives (MSG, artificial sweeteners, etc.) - Sweeteners and additives can spike your blood sugar levels drastically.The best solution is to fix insulin resistance with healthy keto and intermittent fasting.Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:Dr. Berg, 56 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

These are the key player of antimicrobial resistance. If you like the video please share with students and do not forget to subscribe the youtube channel for more videos and updates. Enzymes are macromolecular biological catalysts. Macromolecule means large-sized molecules and biological catalyst means these are produced by living organisms to perform and speed up a chemical reaction. Let me tell you a very simple reason to study enzymes for human benefits. Almost all the metabolic processes in the cell need enzyme catalysis in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life. I guess that reason is good enough to study enzymes.-lactam antibiotics (beta-lactam antibiotics) are a class of antibiotic consisting of all antibiotic agents that contain a beta-lactam ring in their molecular structures. This includes penicillin derivatives There are many different classes of antibiotics and beta-lactams are one of the most important example is penicillin.These antibiotics all have a common element in their molecular structure: a four-atom ring known as a -lactam. Through hydrolysis, the lactamase enzyme breaks the -lactam ring open, deactivating the molecule's antibacterial properties.Beta-lactamase enzymatic activity can be detected using nitrocefin, a chromogenic cephalosporin substrate. The bacterial supernatant is incubated with the substrate nitrocefin and by the action of the beta-lactamase the beta-lactam ring present in the substrate is dissociated and the pink colored compound is produced. The change in color indicates that the bacteria are producing the lactamase enzyme.Support my work at https://www.patreon.com/user?u=37177596 Twitter: https://twitter.com/DrKumarLokender Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/lokenderkumar.sharma Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-lokender-kumar-58525945/ Disclaimer: The information provided is for educational purposes only.

Dr Lamanna reports findings from the RESONATE-2 (NCT01722487) and ELEVATE CLL TN (NCT02475681) trials, highlighting the efficacy of BTK inhibitors in older, treatment-nave patients. In the former trial, ibrutinib was superior to chlorambucil in terms of progression-free survival at a follow-up of seven years, whereas in the latter, acalabrutinib combination treatment was more efficacious than chlorambucil and obinutuzumab treatment. Additionally, evidence from the CLL14 trial (NCT02242942) suggests that a combination of the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax and obinutuzumab are effective in these patients. For younger patients who develop BTK-inhibitor-resistant mutations such as BTK C481S and PLCG2 mutations, venetoclax and the non-covalent BTK inhibitor pirtobrutinib may be effective.

So all of the treatments designed around peripheral neuropathy is sort of to try and manage medicines like Lyrica, or Gabapentin, or narcotic pain medication and then there's a whole slew of other treatments that really cross over into the snake oil department, none of that even claims to cure neuropathy. It's sort of all just to try and manage the symptom.One of the most important advances in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy is the concept of what is actually causing the pain. In many patients with peripheral neuropathy, the actual clinical symptoms, the numbness, the burning, the tingling, the weakness, et cetera, is secondary to mechanical compression that is developed. So these nerves are being squeezed or pinched. There's a metabolic process in diabetics, for example, or somebody with hypothyroidism, although very often you can't really identify whatever the underlying process is, but that's not as important as what it does to the nerves, which is it causes these nerves to swell.So these nerves become pinched, they run in tight spaces, especially around joints and places like that. So if you have a defined space and all of a sudden the nerves start to swell and become larger, pretty soon, the tissue around the nerve starts acting as a mechanical compression point on the nerve. And this is what is actually causing much of the clinical symptoms in patients with peripheral neuropathy. If you can identify which nerves and exactly at what locations the pressure on the nerves is being applied, you can go in surgically and decompress the nerves. The concept is the same as you would do for somebody who has carpal tunnel syndrome.It's well-accepted to decompress nerves in the upper extremity for somebody with diabetes who has the same symptoms in their hands and arms as they do in their lower legs and feet. But nobody ever thinks about doing surgery for the nerves down in the lower legs, and it's the same process that's going on. So that's really an important point to understand in regards with treatment of peripheral neuropathy nowadays.Website: https://nevadanervesurgery.org/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/timtollestrupmd/",Tim Tollestrup MD,https://www.youtube.com/UC-VFfDPY155CIf5tFq10LEA,7.6K subscribers

In addition, because there are so many different kind of nerves, issues can arise in the form as loss of sensation,  muscle movement, or even internal functions (blood pressure, digestion, etc).Peripheral Neuropathy is something you do not want to mess with or let progress.  We, here at In Motion OC, are able to help nerves maintain function and facilitate proper motor patterns, along with balance training.  If you are experiencing tingling, weakness or sharp pain in your hands or feet, don't hesitate to contact us!www.inmotionoc.com949-861-8600",0,0,0

This video explains what you can do to prevent or treat this long-term side effect.Transcription:[00:00:06] Dr. Susan Love: I'm Dr. Susan Love and I'm the chief visionary officer of the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation. Our mission is a future without breast cancer. We do that through innovative research into the cause and prevention of the disease. ImPatient Science is a series of videos that help explain to you breast cancer, how it works, and what your choices and options are.[00:00:29] Female Speaker: Your healthcare team may not be aware of a common type of long-term collateral damage called peripheral neuropathy or pain and numbness in the hands and feet. Neuropathy is a type of nerve damage that can be caused by chemotherapy. If you have symptoms of neuropathy during treatment, doctors will typically lower the dose you are getting. That may help. For some patients, the pain and numbness can continue for years after the treatment ends.[00:00:52] Dr. Susan: We know very little about how long neuropathy can last and how many breast cancer patients it affects. Researchers don't often study it and doctors don't always ask their patients about it.[00:01:03] Female Speaker: If you do develop neuropathy, it can have a profound effect on your quality of life. What can you do? The best option is prevention. The chemotherapy drugs most likely to cause neuropathy are the taxanes like Taxol and Taxotere.[00:01:18] Dr. Susan: If these drugs are being recommended, ask your doctor if there might be alternatives. You need to weigh the risks and benefits of each drug.[00:01:27] Female Speaker: If you are older, overweight, had a mastectomy or had a high number of positive lymph nodes, your risk of developing long-term neuropathy may be higher. In this case, a conversation with your doctor will be especially important.[00:01:39] Dr. Susan: A small study recently found that wearing cooled gloves and socks while receiving chemotherapy reduce the amount of drugs the hands and feet received and, therefore, the risk for neuropathy.[00:01:51] Female Speaker: The most important thing is to talk to your doctor about it. It's the best way to address the collateral damage that you are experiencing.[00:01:58] Dr. Susan: If you have neuropathy, ask for a referral to a palliative care specialist. They are the experts in treating the short and long-term consequences of cancer and its treatment.[00:02:08] Female Speaker: By talking about your experiences, your doctors will be better prepared to help you deal with collateral damage and improve your quality of life. It will also help them support other cancer patients and that's something to feel good about.[00:02:22] Dr. Susan: The Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation is dedicated to a future without breast cancer. We do this through innovative research into the cause and prevention of the disease. We ask you to join us at drsusanloveresearch.org. You can participate in our research. You can support our research.

Damage to peripheral nerves may impair sensation, movement, gland or organ function depending on which nerves are affected; in other words, neuropathy affecting motor, sensory, or autonomic nerves result in different symptoms. More than one type of nerve may be affected simultaneously. Peripheral neuropathy may be acute or chronic , and may be reversible or permanent. Common causes include systemic diseases , hyperglycemia-induced glycation, vitamin deficiency, medication , traumatic injury, including ischemia, radiation therapy, excessive alcohol consumption, immune system disease, coeliac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, or viral infection. It can also be genetic or idiopathic . In conventional medical usage, the word neuropathy without modifier usually means peripheral neuropathy. Neuropathy affecting just one nerve is called ""mononeuropathy"" and neuropathy involving nerves in roughly the same areas on both sides of the body is called ""symmetrical polyneuropathy"" or simply ""polyneuropathy"". When two or more separate nerves in disparate areas of the body are affected it is called ""mononeuritis multiplex"", ""multifocal mononeuropathy"", or ""multiple mononeuropathy"".Neuropathy may cause painful cramps, fasciculations , muscle loss, bone degeneration, and changes in the skin, hair, and nails. Additionally, motor neuropathy may cause impaired balance and coordination or, most commonly, muscle weakness; sensory neuropathy may cause numbness to touch and vibration, reduced position sense causing poorer coordination and balance, reduced sensitivity to temperature change and pain, spontaneous tingling or burning pain, or skin allodynia ; and autonomic neuropathy may produce diverse symptoms, depending on the affected glands and organs, but common symptoms are poor bladder control, abnormal blood pressure or heart rate, and reduced ability to sweat normally.------To see your favorite topic here, fill out this request form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScU0dLbeWsc01IC0AaO8sgaSgxMFtvBL31c_pjnwEZUiq99Fw/viewform ------Source: Wikipedia.org articles, adapted under https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ license.

It is not a disease itself, but a symptom of other diseases.[10] The term dry is used only when referring to a limb or to the gut (in other locations, this same type of necrosis is called an infarction, such as myocardial infarction).[11] Dry gangrene is often due to peripheral artery disease, but can be due to acute limb ischemia. As a result, people with arteriosclerosis, high cholesterol, diabetes and smokers commonly have dry gangrene.[12] The limited oxygen in the ischemic limb limits putrefaction and bacteria fail to survive. The affected part is dry, shrunken, and dark reddish-black. The line of separation usually brings about complete separation, with eventual falling off of the gangrenous tissue if it is not removed surgically, a process called autoamputation.[12]Dry gangrene is the result of chronic ischemia without infection. If ischemia is detected early, when ischemic wounds rather than gangrene are present, the process can be treated by revascularization (via vascular bypass or angioplasty).[13] However, once gangrene has developed, the affected tissues are not salvageable.[14] Because dry gangrene is not accompanied by infection, it is not as emergent as gas gangrene or wet gangrene, both of which have a risk of sepsis. Over time, dry gangrene may develop into wet gangrene if an infection develops in the dead tissues.[15]",Medical Centric,https://www.youtube.com/UC-_aWEhUBpH86D1VR0OhVrw,178K subscribers

PT2M8S,FZfz-K0VZXk,What is Prediabetes?,6734,2020-09-16,,94,1.0,"Did you know one in three American adults have prediabetes? What does that really mean? Prediabetes is when your blood sugar levels are running higher than normal but they haven't quite reached the type 2 diabetes numbers. that means that your cells are not effectively using insulin and blood sugar like they should. Insulin is a hormone produced from the pancreas. After a meal your pancreas releases insulin to get that sugar into your cells. When you have prediabetes, or insulin resistance, that insulin is unable to get into your cells to open it up to all that sugar. So, all of that extra sugar runs into your blood, leading to elevated glucose levels. You may be at risk for prediabetes if you're over the age of 45, have a family history of type 2 diabetes, if you are a pregnant woman and had gestational diabetes, have elevated blood pressure levels, have elevated cholesterol levels, or are physically inactive. All of these things put you at a greater risk for developing prediabetes, and then, potentially, type 2 diabetes. There are several things you can do to reduce your risk of developing prediabetes. Start eating more fruits and vegetables; they contain a lot of fiber which is very great for your heart and helps to keep you fuller for longer. Start to minimize your portions; try using measuring spoons and measuring cups when you're eating. Another thing you can do is start to move your body more. Aim for 150 minutes a week of physical activity. That can be walking, biking, yoga, or even strength training. If you're currently a smoker, pursue options to stop. Talk to your provider or join a group. Another thing you can do is be mindful of your beverage intake. Choose water more, and try to eliminate sugar-sweetened beverages; they have a lot of calories and have a great impact on blood sugar. If you believe you may be at risk for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes reach out to your provider today to schedule an appointment.https://www.chihealth.com/en/services/primary-care/diabetes/prediabetes.html",CHI Health,https://www.youtube.com/UCiFio83cHZZPbHp8_ZHGCdw,31.5K subscribers

Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. Diabetes refers to a group of conditions characterized by high levels of blood glucose, commonly known as blood sugar. Glucose comes from digestion of carbohydrates in food, and is carried by the bloodstream to various body tissues. But glucose cannot cross the cell membrane to enter the cells on its own; to do so, it requires assistance from a hormone produced by the pancreas called insulin. Binding of insulin to its receptor on a target cell triggers a signaling cascade that brings glucose transporters to the cell membrane, creating passageways for glucose to enter the cells. In most tissues, muscles for example, glucose is used as an energy source, while in the liver and adipose tissue, it is also stored for later use, in the form of glycogen and fats.  When the body is in the fasted state, the liver produces and secretes glucose into the blood, while adipose tissues release free fatty acids to the liver where they are converted into additional metabolic fuel. Diabetes happens when insulin is either deficient or its action is compromised. Without insulin, glucose cannot enter the cells; it stays in the blood, causing high blood sugar levels.There are 2 major types of diabetes. Type 1 is when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin; and type 2 is when the bodys cells do not respond well to insulin - they are insulin-resistant. Both types are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors but genetics plays a major role in type 1, while lifestyle is a predominant risk factor for type 2. For this reason, type 1 diabetes usually starts suddenly in childhood, while type 2 progresses gradually during adulthood, going through a so called pre-diabetic stage, which is defined as borderline blood sugar levels. Pre-diabetes is very common. Unhealthy lifestyle is the trigger of pre-diabetes and the main driving force behind its progression to diabetes type 2. The key factors are obesity and physical inactivity. There are at least 2 ways by which obesity can cause insulin resistance and high blood glucose. First, in obesity, fat cells have to process more nutrients than they can manage and become stressed. As a result, they release inflammatory mediators, known as cytokines. Cytokines interfere with the signaling cascade by insulin receptor, blocking the action of insulin.Second, excess adipose tissue releases abnormally large amount of free fatty acids to the liver  an event that normally happens only when the body is fasting. This tricks the liver into producing and releasing more glucose into the blood. High blood glucose stimulates further insulin secretion. Constant high insulin levels de-sensitize body tissues, causing insulin insensitivity. Intra-abdominal fat appears to produce more fatty acids and cytokines, and therefore has more severe effect on blood glucose, than subcutaneous, or peripheral fat. For this reason, large waist size is a greater risk factor than high body mass index.Sedentary lifestyle, apart from having indirect effect by causing weight gain, has its own direct impact on insulin resistance. This is because physical activity is required to maintain healthy blood sugar levels. Physical activity increases energy demand by the muscles, which consume glucose from the blood, and subsequently from glucose storage in the liver and adipose tissue. High energy expenditure helps to clear up faster the spikes of blood glucose that follow every meal. High energy demand also promotes better cellular response to insulin, increasing insulin sensitivity. Physical inactivity, even for a short period of time, results in consistently higher spikes of blood sugar after meals, which can trigger pre-diabetic changes in healthy individuals, or speed up transition from pre-diabetes to diabetes. This happens not only to over-weight patients, but also to people with seemingly healthy weight.",Alila Medical Media,https://www.youtube.com/UCiTGKA9W0G0TL8Hm7Uf_u9A,837K subscribers

If your doctor has told you that you have prediabetes, he or she has also probably also told you it can be reversed by making certain lifestyle changes. Reversing it permanently, however, requires the discipline to continue pursuing those lifestyle changes so that your blood sugar stays below prediabetes levels.There are a number of common sense ways to do that.Lose 5-7 Percent of Your Body WeightLosing weight will help reduce inflammation, making it easier for your pancreas to function. When your pancreas doesn't produce the amount of insulin you need, sugar levels go up.ExerciseIf youre prediabetic, its really important to get regular exercise. Exercise makes your muscles use up excess blood sugar. It also helps you lose weight by using the insulin your body produces more effectively. See ""Links To Related Sources"" for a list of exercises you can do at home.Eat More VegetablesVegetables contain fibers that contribute to keeping your glucose levels in a good place. Theyre also high in vitamins and minerals that keep your body systems working at maximum efficiency.  Beware of ""Bad"" CarbsCarbohydrates in your food break down glucose in your blood, so your cells get less of what they need. There are three categories of carbs.Refined carbs are especially bad, and are found in baked goods like donuts, pasta or white bread.  Simple carbohydrates are fast acting and cause an immediate boost in blood sugar. These are found in foods like fruits, juices, maple syrup, milk, yogurt, and honey.Complex carbohydrates are better for you because they take longer for our body to break down. They're absorbed more slowly, which helps keep blood sugar stable. Examples of complex carbs include most vegetables, unprocessed whole grains, and beans.In certain cases, your doctor may suggest a medication called metformin to help manage or reverse prediabetes. Metformin is mainly for anyone who has a very high risk of developing type 2 diabetes after being diagnosed with prediabetes. It works by keeping the liver from making more glucose when you dont need it, thereby keeping your blood glucose level in a healthy range.If you've been diagnosed with prediabetes, you need to be proactive and do whatever you can to reverse it. This means making the necessary lifestyle changes and working with your doctor to help control your blood sugar.

In a prediabetic state, you have either hypoglycemia or insulin resistance that later turns into diabetes. A big indicator that you may have this condition is not being satisfied after a meal. In a cell that has insulin resistance, the fuel is blocked and cant go into the cell. The cell is starving of fuel and certain nutrients. In a normal cell, the fuel can go in easily. When the cell is starving of fuel, it sends a signal to the pancreas telling it to produce more insulin. Instead of consuming more food or something sweet, you may want to add more fat to your diet. Fat will not increase insulin by much. Adding more fat can help you feel more satisfied. Over time, if youre not hungry and eating the wrong foods, you may be able to heal insulin resistance.Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio: Dr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

The condition is characterized by high blood glucose levels which are not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. It occurs as a result of the body's inability to produce or utilize the insulin hormone properly which leads to excessive glucose buildup in the blood. However, the good news is that people with prediabetes can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes by switching to a healthy lifestyle.

Large trials examining cardiovascular outcomes and mortalities suggested an increased incidence of new onset diabetes with long term use of diuretics. Likewise, other studies have reported an increased incidence of diabetes in people treated with statins, prompting the US Food and Drug Administration to release a safety label change in 2012. Furthermore,  blockers have been implicated in impaired glucose metabolism, especially with diuretics.Large scale studies with serial glucose measurements examining the association between these drugs and new onset diabetes in patients with impaired glucose tolerance are limited. We reanalysed data from the Nateglinide and Valsartan in Impaired Glucose Tolerance Outcomes Research (NAVIGATOR) study to examine the relation between risk of new onset diabetes and use of  blockers, thiazide diuretics, or statins in treatment nave patients.In this study, the researchers set out to examine the degree to which use of  blockers, statins, and diuretics in patients with impaired glucose tolerance and other cardiovascular risk factors is associated with new onset diabetes.",The BMJ,https://www.youtube.com/UCrkhryqZABVzsGvfeAp0uIw,33.1K subscribers

Diabetes is a condition of high sugar (hyperglycemia). The purpose of the medication that diabetic takes is to lower blood sugars  sometimes the medication could drive the blood sugar too low that could cause hypoglycemia. When you do intermittent fasting, you decrease the need for insulin and the medication for a diabetic. The insulin that the diabetic is taking is not the same as the body produces. Is Intermittent Fasting Dangerous?  Not if you do it gradually and if you dont adjust your medication.

Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.Diabetic neuropathy is nerve damage caused by diabetes. It is the most common diabetic complication, affecting at least 50% of all patients.Chronic high blood sugar levels cause progressive injury to neurons. Sensory neurons are usually the first to be affected, followed by autonomic neurons that control internal organs. Rarely, motor neurons that activate voluntary movements may also be impaired later in the disease, albeit to a lesser extent.There are several types of diabetic neuropathy. A patient may develop more than one type at a time.The most common is peripheral neuropathy. Its also called distal symmetric polyneuropathy because it typically involves multiple peripheral nerves, on both sides of the body, and affects the longest sensory axons that convey sensations from the feet, legs, and hands. Symptoms develop on the body in that order and include numbness, tingling, or burning sensation, which usually worsen at night. Sensitivity to pain can either be exaggerated, or, on the contrary, lost. Loss of sensation leads to increased risk of painless injuries, which often go unnoticed and therefore untreated. This, together with slow healing caused by diabetes, can turn minor cuts or blisters into serious infections. Autonomic neuropathy affects nerves that control activities of internal organs. In cardiac autonomic neuropathy, nerves that regulate heart rate and blood pressure are damaged. As a result, the body reacts more slowly to change of position, and patients may feel lightheadedness when standing up. Other signs include rapid heart rates, or sudden, unexplained changes in heart rate.In the digestive system, nerve damage may cause nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, difficulty swallowing, slow stomach emptying, and bowel problems.Neuropathy in the urinary and reproductive systems may lead to urinary retention, hesitancy, urinary incontinence, and sexual dysfunctions.Nerve damage in the eyes can cause slower adjustment to changes in light and darkness.Nerve damage in sweat glands may result in either absence of sweat or heavy sweating, especially at night; different parts of the body may also produce sweat differently.Another effect of autonomic neuropathy is hypoglycemia unawareness, meaning the body is unaware when blood sugar levels are low. Warning signs such as hunger or dizziness cannot be felt, and patients may pass out before taking steps to increase their blood sugar.Mononeuropathy, or focal neuropathy, is dysfunction of a single nerve, typically due to entrapment. A common example is carpal tunnel syndrome, in which the median nerve is compressed as it passes through a narrow tunnel in the wrist, causing pain, numbness, and tingling in the hand. Damage to a cranial nerve can cause problems with vision or loss of control of facial muscles.Proximal neuropathy is a rare type of nerve damage affecting the thighs, hip, buttock, and occasionally, the abdomen or chest, typically on one side of the body. Symptoms include severe pain in the affected areas, and thigh muscle weakness and wasting. Diabetic neuropathy can be prevented by effectively controlling blood sugar levels. Managing diabetes also helps slow the progression of damage. Treatments aim to relieve pain and symptoms, to restore functions and prevent further complications. Treatments vary depending on the affected organs.",Alila Medical Media,https://www.youtube.com/UCiTGKA9W0G0TL8Hm7Uf_u9A,838K subscribers

You could reveal your risk of high blood sugar signs by checking your urine. Does your wee smell like this?Strong-smelling urine has several possible causes. One possibility, diabetes, is a serious medical concern.Your urine or pee is a way for your body to get rid of extra water. In addition, your body tries to flush out a lot of unnecessary materials through your urine.The urine contains a chemical called ammonia, which sometimes gives your urine a strong odor (smell). Urine is a way for the body to get rid of things that might be harmful to it or might be building up in excess within the body.Normally, your urine is yellowish in color and has no specific or somewhat strong odor.Something strange happens to the urine odor for type 2 diabetes. The urine starts smelling sweet or fruity. Why does the smell change?Find out in this video.Like and subscribe to our channel to find out more about signs and symptoms of high blood sugar.

Is the A1C test accurate?The A1C test is a great test to do as part of your evaluation, but dont completely rely on it.What is the A1C test?If you have high sugar in your blood, and it combines with the red blood cell, it can be measured by the A1C test. If your A1C level is 6.5 or more that would be diabetes. If the A1C test score is this high, there is also a correlation with increased retinopathy.If you decrease this number by 1%:  Your death rate from diabetes goes down 27%  Microvascular complications go down 37%  Myocardial Infarction goes down 14%However, about 30% of the population is anemic. If youre anemic, the A1C test will be invalid.Other things that could make the test invalid are:  Sickle cell  Iron diseaseRed blood cells die a lot sooner in a diabetic than they do in a healthy person. If you measure the red blood cells with a short period of exposure to glucose, it can dramatically affect what shows up on the A1C results. This is because the test is all about how long the red blood cells are exposed to glucose.Better tests would be:  Fasting glucose  Post-meal glucose  HOMA-IRIf you have both high blood sugar and ketones in the morning, it could be because of the dawn phenomenon. The dawn phenomenon is due to gluconeogenesis, which means youre making glucose from fat, ketones, and protein. This is happening because youve had insulin resistance for a long time.You dont really need to be concerned about this. Its just a part of the transition phase if you have had chronic insulin resistance.Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:Dr. Berg, 56 years of age is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

Red blood cells contain hemoglobin and when the hemoglobin binds with glucose in the blood, it becomes glycated. When the hemoglobin binds to oxygen, the cells appear red. The term HbA1c refers to glycated hemoglobin. The more glycated hemoglobin is made, the higher the percentage of HbA1c. a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test is good for monitoring long-term glucose (sugar) control in people with diabetes.  HbA1c is a percentage of the glycated hemoglobin relative to the total hemoglobin in the blood. The normal range of HbA1c is 4-6%. More than 7% is high. With more glucose present in the blood, the more likely that the glucose will interact with the hemoglobin and make more glycated hemoglobin.  HbA1c is a better measurement used to track the progress of diabetes than a blood sugar test.  The blood sugar test does not give the big picture. Blood sugar in the body changes during the day depending on diet and level of activity, so the blood sugar test is not very accurate. The HbA1c is used to measure how much sugar a person has in their blood over a longer period of time, which is usually 3 months. The lifespan of red blood cells is about 120 days, while the life span of hemoglobin is on average only two months. The HbA1c is usually done 2-4 times a year. The higher the HbA1c, the higher the risk of diabetic complications. a decrease of 1% in HbA1c decreases the risk of microvascular complications by 37%.Diabetes is a serious disease that affects the eyes. Kidneys, heart and feet. How does hemoglobin work? The red blood cells contain large quantities of proteins called hemoglobin which bind to oxygen loosely and reversibly. The hemoglobin molecules are composed of four subunits: each hemoglobin contains four heme molecules, one attached to each subunit and iron containing pigment that binds oxygen. Oxygen molecule bind at the center of each heme molecule. Heme makes it possible for the red blood cells to pick up oxygen for delivery to the cells of the body. Hemoglobin that is saturated with oxygen is called oxyhemoglobin and is bright red in color. Glycated hemoglobin decreased the oxygen carrying capacity and limits the tissue oxygen delivery. Hemoglobin releases its oxygen when the red blood cells pass through capillaries where the oxygen then moves out of the capillaries and on to the cells where it is needed. In diabetes, glycated hemoglobin limits delivery of oxygen to the tissues. The physician should be alert of surgical wound complications in patients with a high hemoglobin  A1c test.

Is it a delusion of grandeur to think that I could have a medical eponym of my own? Perhaps, but I will try regardless - please take my self-aggrandizement cum grano salis. Without further ado, I present:""The Rule of Thomas"" for quickly calculating average blood glucose levels from Hemoglobin A1C percentages. Use the following formula:Average Blood Glucose = 120 mg/dL + 30 (HgbA1C% - 6%)Plug in your variable, namely the Hemoglobin A1C Percentage, and solve the equation. You will be left with an average blood glucose.For example, your 30 year old patient with type 1 diabetes typically has excellent control of their blood sugar. Because your patient is young and healthy, you encourage them to maintain tight glucose control. You order a blood draw and obtain a hemoglobin A1C level of 6.5%. You would then have to use a table to find what their average blood glucose would be, but if you use the Rule of Thomas, you will be able to calculate the average blood glucose quickly.Average Blood Glucose = 120 mg/dL + 30 (6.5% - 6%)Average Blood Glucose = 120 mg/dL + 30 (0.5%)Average Blood Glucose = 120 mg/dL + 15 mg/dLAverage Blood Glucose = 135 mg/dLAs another example, you have a 58 year old male with type 2 diabetes that is newly diagnosed and poorly controlled. His hemoglobin A1C level prior to treatment is 12%. Using the formula:Average Blood Glucose = 120 mg/dL + 30 (12% - 6%)Average Blood Glucose = 120 mg/dL + 30 (6%) Average Blood Glucose = 120 mg/dL + 180 mg/dLAverage Blood Glucose = 300 mg/dLAs the medical community moves to patient-centered approaches to managing chronic illness, The Rule of Thomas is an easy way for clinicians and patients to understand and work with Hemoglobin A1c levels and their correlating average blood glucose levels. The Rule of Thomas will help patients and clinicians communicate more easily about hemoglobin A1c and glucose levels.#bloodsugar   #diabetes   #diabetesmellitus   #type2diabetes   #bloodglucose   #hemoglobinA1c   #medicine   #clinic   #hospital   #medicaleponyms   #RuleofThomas   #endocrine   #endocrinology   #medicaleducation     #patientcentered   #patientcommunication  Key Links:Translating the A1C Assay Into Estimated Average Glucose Values:http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/31/8/1473.abstractADA Hemoglobin A1c to Average Glucose Level:http://professional.diabetes.org/glucosecalculator.aspxMayo Clinic Hemoglobin A1c conversion chart:http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/a1c-test/basics/results/prc-20012585",Plum Health DPC,https://www.youtube.com/UCh0o2rFFD_fSCPydqXxYj8A,1.31K subscribers

There is a chemical called ALLOXAN, which is a toxic glucose analogue (mimicker) that can kill the beta cells of the pancreas, the cells that make insulin. In fact, it is used to induce diabetes in rats. And you can produce alloxan by combining the bleaching chemical called chloride oxide with protein. They use this chemical in making white flour products. It goes beyond white flour - what about breads, pasta, cereal, crackers, waffles, cakes, etc? Could this be one reason why many children get diabetes?DATA & RESEARCH:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloxanhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1...https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/...https://thedailyhealth.co.uk/alloxan-...Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio: Dr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

If you or someone you know has this condition, you know theyre consuming frequent high-carb meals resulting in high insulin.High insulin causes acanthosis nigricans, along with insulin resistance  a pre-diabetic condition. People with diabetes can also develop darkened skin folds.But you can reverse acanthosis nigricans if you reduce your insulin. I recommend doing keto and intermittent fasting to get your insulin levels down.I also want to mention theres another condition that mimics acanthosis nigricans. Its called pellagra. Its not as common, but can give you a similar darkening around your neck. Pellagra is caused by a vitamin B3 deficiency, often caused by eating too many ground corn products such as grits or corn chips.If your skin folds have darkened, I encourage you to do keto and intermittent fasting to lower your insulin and reverse the condition.Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio: Dr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

Other dark spot episodes discussed a type of raised dark spot: moles. In this episode of DermTV, Dr. Schultz discusses yet another type of raised dark spots: Acanthosis Nigricans.Subscribe to DermTV:http://www.youtube.com/dermtvdotcomhttp://DermTV.comConnect with DermTV:http://www.facebook.com/dermtvhttp://www.twitter.com/dermtv[TRANSCRIPT]The skin condition called Acanthosis Nigricans fortunately is uncommon, but pseudo Acanthosis Nigricans unfortunately isn't. If you were formally schooled in Latin, you know exactly what I'm talking about. But if you weren't, stay tuned!Let's start with what Acanthosis Nigricans (which I'm going to refer to as AN in this episode). Start with what it looks like, which'll then make you want to know more. And just to make it a little more interesting, the real Acanthosis Nigricans and ""faux"" Acanthosis Nigricans, which is the more common Pseudo Acanthosis Nigricans, look essentially identical.Since Acanthosis just means a thickening or overgrowth of the upper layer of your skin and Nigricans really means dark or black, if we put this together its really a descriptive term from which you expect to see a dark overgrowth or thickening of your skin. Acanthosis Nigricans appears as tan to dark brown velvety surfaced plaques with parallel lines which when even deeper look like velvety parallel ribs like the nap of carpeting. You usually get it on the parts of the body where skin tends to rub against skin, such as underarms, neck and upper inner thighs, but it can occur in other areas as well. Because these brown, raised, unattractive patches and plaques don't itch or burn or in any other way bother you except cosmetically, which is personally important and a real quality of life issue, the medical importance of Acanthosis Nigricans is why it occurs and whether it reflects something important internally.Most cases of Acanthosis Nigricans are not true Acanthosis Nigricans, but fortunately the Pseudo form which occurs from being overweight. The real Acanthosis Nigricans comes from certain endocrine diseases such as diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, other less common hormonal imbalances, but, and most importantly, Acanthosis Nigricans can be a reflection of an internal cancer which most commonly are malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract, uterus and sometimes even the lung, prostate, breast or ovary. And last there are some people who have Acanthosis Nigricans with no apparent associated disease and are not overweight. For the first group whose Acanthosis is associated with obesity, endocrine problems or cancers, treating the underlying condition will result in a remarkable improvement of the Acanthosis, but what about those people who fortunately don't have an underlying disease causing this but still have the cosmetic impact of thickened brown skin? For those people there are ways of minimizing the cosmetic impact of this unusual rash. Because it's caused by thickening and darkening of the skin, treatment with products that bleach the extra brown and reduce the dead layers of the skin are helpful.So believe it or not, even with the unusual, here we are back to treatment with exfoliants and bleaches once again. [ABOUT DERMTV]Everyone can have beautiful, healthy, and younger looking skin, and DermTV, the Internet's daily skincare video show, will demonstrate how by revealing expert tips and techniques and by providing real solutions for real skincare issues.Skincare (whether cosmetic or medical) previously required a trip to your dermatologist or a shopping spree at the pharmacy.

This is seen as hyperpigmeneted  and in some condition  it   even  it is associated  with itching. So this manifestation of skin can be because  of obsisity or seen in people  who are diabetic or  hormonal imbalance or  extreme cases of  malignancy. If you are looking for management of  this , you need to see the causative  factors. In diabetes, the blood sugar levels need to be maintained, in hormonal imbalance the hormone has to be maintained,  your  lifestyle activities in case of ladies  if they have gynaecological issues this  has to be manage before maintaining  the skin conditions. In people with obesity they are seen to have such conditions. Weight loss management has to be seen.   Detoxification is the primary thing then  it comes to  any chronic skin related issue. Ayurevda cleanses  the body  before you starts  such treatments. Various treatments and external applications can be used in such conditions, for example  karpura,  the camphor with coconut  oil, karpuradi  taila has to be  used . This has to be applied this is proved to be antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral too. This can be applied and scrubbed  with eladi podi  which is  another combination of powders this gives very good results.

However, although diagnosing  this specific type of diabetes during pregnancy is very important to the health of you and your baby, there are several alternatives to Glucola drink that have been kept a secret!Our CajunStork is here to share these alternatives to glucola test during pregnancy with you now!There are several reasons why moms like you are seeking alternatives to Glucola Syrup test that are more traditional. For starters, there has been an uproar in the TrulyNatural community about the nasty ingredients in the Glucola drink. Midwives, on the other hand, have traditionally used a much more natural, food-based alternative to this Glucola test during pregnancy. In fact, in my birth center practice, we use the pancake breakfast as the initial standard for testing your bodys response to sugar as an alternative to Glucola. We also use extensive nutritional counseling to help you stay on track with your diet if you do in fact have diet-controlled gestational diabetes.In this video, I also go on to discuss more Glucose Tolerance Test alternatives to even the pancake breakfast for moms who already have pristine diets and may not want to put their pregnant body through the 50 grams of sugar overload.Here is the introductory video to alternatives to Glucola test.

Yeboah (KNUST) and Cary Engleberg (University of Michigan). This programme is intended as a compendium of modules on procedures in clinical chemistry. At present, the only completed module is one concerning the conduct and interpretation of the glucose tolerance test (GTT). In a GTT, glucose is adminstered to the patient in order to determine how quickly it is cleared from the blood. The test is usually used to test for diabetes, insulin resistance, and sometimes reactive hypoglycemia. The glucose is most often given orally so the common test is technically an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). This video addresses the question: What are the expected results in a normal individual?The complete learning module is available through the African Health OER Network at: http://open.umich.edu/education/med/oernetwork/med/internal/clinical-chemistry/2009.

And what this involves is drinking a very sugary drink and getting your blood tested an hour later to see what your blood sugar is. And if it's high, then it means that you probably have gestational diabetes. Now, women who had diabetes prior to getting pregnant will usually know this, and if you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, then this will hopefully have already been addressed up to this point. But this test is still usually indicated to find out how things are being managed.A lot of people wonder if they can eat or drink whatever they like before they take the test, and you can. There aren't any special preparations that need to be made leading up to taking the test. However, if the first test result comes back abnormal, then your doctor will send you for a second test, and you do need to be fasting for that one - at least for 8 to 14 hours. I do recommend calling your doctor's office though, and ask them if they have any special instructions for you. And if they do, then of course, it would be best to follow those.

Now What?,3398,2020-09-16,"diabetes, chi health, blood sugar, A1C",50,0.0,"Now is a great opportunity for you to take a look at this disease as something you can live with, and how it can actually make you healthier because you're going to have a different focus on diet and exercise now. For me, being diagnosed with diabetes, it drew me more to think, How can I have a healthier diet? Part of the answer being to eat more fruits and vegetables and drink more water. It helps me to remember my focus on exercise, because exercise burns blood sugar; get out and be active! If you've never had an exercise routine before, now is a great time to start. Go ahead and take the walk around the block, or go for a walk over your lunch hour. If you really want to join a gym, do that! Find something you enjoy; the best thing you're going to do for yourself is to be active in something that you enjoy doing. If you're someone that only drinks soda, stop drinking soda, stop drinking juices, and stop drinking sugar-sweetened drinks. Sart drinking more water! The next thing I would encourage you to do is to schedule an appointment with one of the Diabetes Educators. We can help put this all in perspective. It can be really hard when you're only getting information from various websites, or getting information from your aunt, uncle, neighbor and everyone's telling you what you can and can't do. Find a trained educator that will be able to put that together for you. We can make this something you can live with.Why do I need to test my blood sugar?Many people diagnosed with diabetes ask why should I test my blood sugar? For me, I don't think I really know how I feel unless I test it. I look at testing as kind of speedometer. You don't really know how fast or slow you're going unless you're actually looking down at the speedometer. You can be driving in traffic, and believe that you're going the speed limit, but actually when you look down you recognize that you might be going 10, 15, even 20 miles an hour over the limit. You felt fine because everyone else was driving that speed. The same can be said for your blood sugar. We get used to how we feel on a day-to-day basis, and if we don't test our blood sugar we may not even recognize that our numbers are higher or lower than theyre supposed to be. Testing is a great way to keep yourself honest, as well as to give you the great information when you're succeeding and the exercising and your diet are really paying off.How often do I need to test my blood sugar?For most people with diabetes, testing once a day is all you need to do. Find the best time of day for you. Providers like to see a variety of tests, for example first thing in the morning and also 1 to 2 hours after a meal. However if you feel like you can't get that done, at least get testing in once a day when it fits in your life. This is a disease you will have for the rest of your life, so we want this to be something you can feel successful in!https://www.chihealth.com/en/services/primary-care/diabetes.html",CHI Health,https://www.youtube.com/UCiFio83cHZZPbHp8_ZHGCdw,31.4K subscribers

But even seasoned hospital personnel were startled when his labs came back and his glucose reading was at 705.""And the doctor said to me: You are a walking dead man, "" recalls Mr. Braithwaite, who had been feeling weak, constantly thirsty and urinating frequently. She said my blood sugar was probably in the 1,000s earlier in the day. She said that anyone who comes in here with a blood sugar of 700 is usually unconscious.""That was April 22 of this year, when Mr. Braithwaite's already busy and traumatic life was upended further with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, and having to potentially face years of insulin injections and other medications to control his blood sugar level. Normal glucose readings for healthy individuals should fall within 70-100 mg/dL when fasting, and less than 180 after meals. A blood sugar reading near or at 1,000 usually puts a person into a diabetic coma or unconsciousness.Most people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes don't ""present so dramatically"" as Mr. Braithwaite did, says Pascual De Santis, M.D., an endocrinologist with Baptist Health Primary Care, who is helping guide the paramedic through his post-diagnosis adjustments that include significant lifestyle changes, such as improved nutrition, weight loss and regular exercise.Want to see more?Baptist Health South Floridas Resource Blog https://baptisthealth.net/newsLike us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/baptisthealthsfFollow Baptist Health on Twitter https://www.twitter.com/baptisthealthsfFollow Baptist Health on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/baptisthealthsf/Follow Baptist Health on Pinterest https://www.pinterest.com/baptisthealthsf/[Transcript][Video: Pineapple logo, Text: Living With Diabetes, Taking Steps Beyond Medication, soft, upbeat music][Graphic: Christopher Braithwaite, Patient] April 22nd was a day that I woke up it was a Saturday and I just felt really, really tired that day.

Most of the times the type 1 diabetes presentation is in children. But there are some cases where the type 1 diabetes presents in adolescents and adults. The main symptomatology of type 1 diabetes in adolescents and adults is a bit different from type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes have  lot of polyuria, polyphagia, or polydipsia or drinking excessive water and increased  appetite, but in type 1 diabetes in adolescents and adults, it is usually the weight loss. Usually patient feels  fatigued and patient feels very tired, most if the patient feels  very perspirated and in the late evening and most of the times  the adults feels that they are drained  out and  most of the times the patients  gives  symptoms of peripheral neuritis and tingling and numbness in the feet and hand. So the symptoms of type 1 diabetes in adolescents and adults are quite different from the classical symptoms of type 2 diabetes like polyuria, polyphagia, or polydipsia. Most of the times the type 1 diabetes in adolescents and adults present with lean body weight with classically the weight loss, tiredness perspiration, increased sweating, increased appetite and increased urinations or there may be interplay of one or more  symptoms at one time or patient  may present  with only one symptom. So it is very difficult to recognize the early changes of type 1 diabetes in adolescents and adults.

About two years ago, he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. ""He was using the bathroom a lot; he was consuming tons of water. So we immediately made an appointment at the doctors and he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes,"" says Chris Spencer, Julian's dad. Symptoms often come on slowly- so parents may not notice until their child is in crisis.

Type 1 diabetes used to be called juvenile diabetes, because it often appears in childhood. An autoimmune disease, people either don't make or don't properly utilize insulin. That's the hormone the body uses to turn sugar into fuel. ""Over time that coincides with a gradual increase of blood sugar level and that's when you expect the child to become symptomatic. Drinking a lot, peeing a lot, loss of weight despite an increase in appetite and tiredness,"" says Dr. Jehaimi. With the proper diagnosis and treatment, Julian quickly bounced back.""We didn't realize how much weight he had lost. He had dark circles under his eyes, we didn't really notice, but once he got healthier you could see the glow come back. The irritability from the high blood sugar was now obvious,"" says Jennifer Spencer, Julian's mom.

And so in producing 100% of their insulin needs something comes along that produces pancreatic trauma. Now that could be immediate. And that would be something like if your pancreas is removed and that often occurs if people have chronic pancreatitis or trauma or pancreatic carcinoma.So the more typical person who has Type 1 diabetes has a very sort of rapid onset but takes weeks to months to develop. And in this situation the pancreatic trauma that occurs is related to antibodies production. Often it follows a viral infection, the body produces antibodies against that virus but unfortunately the antibodies also seem to look for the specific cells in the pancreas that produce insulin called beta cells and it destroys them over time. And people in that situation would develop symptoms over weeks to months where the pancreatic trauma event occurs and very quickly insulin production falls very dramatically. So symptoms start quite quickly and it becomes quite obvious.But there is another group of people with Type 1 diabetes who have a very slow progression of diabetes. And they are often misrepresented and thought of as having Type 2 diabetes because it evolves so slowly that their diabetes control can actually deteriorate over years rather than weeks. And so our classic description of someone developing Type 1 diabetes over weeks doesn't quite fit that mould and this group of people are often missed and are often treated with insulin very late.And then the final group of people that we see who have a pancreatic trauma event are people who have for whatever reason a small self-limiting event which takes out a percentage of their pancreatic production. So it may be that a virus comes along the pancreas is affected, it takes about 20% of beta cell function and then they recover. And it may be that they end up still producing a decent amount of insulin and can have a great result with a small amount of insulin to top them up, it may be that they have 50% production of insulin or it might be that they even have 20% or 30%. But this group of people continue to produce insulin forever and their short term self-limiting illness kind of resolves but leaves them with an ongoing permanent reduction in insulin production that requires them to manage their insulin deficiency with insulin in the long term.If you found this video helpful then please subscribe to the channel so that I can keep you up to date as all the new videos come online.",My Health Explained,https://www.youtube.com/UCJZc4FJs8Qfmw-r3xiO-mSA,9.21K subscribers

Check out our freebies and learn more at: (http://www.nursing.com)Insulin Mixing- NPH with Regular- Nursing Skills:In this video, were going to look at how to properly MIX insulins when youre going to give them SubQ. Typically, well mix an intermediate or long acting insulin like NPH with a shorter acting one like Regular insulin. The big rule to remember is you always draw up clear, THEN cloudy. Or the longer acting before the shorter acting.First step is to calculate the total required volume of medication needed. In this case were going to use an example order of 10 units of NPH insulin and 5 units of Regular Insulin. So thats 15 units total.Open both vials and clean the tops of both vials with an alcohol pad.Now, in your insulin syringe, draw back the total amount of air you need. In this case  15 units.Now insert the needle into the NPH vial and inject the NPH dose of AIR into the vial  in this case, 10 units.Remove the needle from the NPH vial, and insert it into the Regular insulin vialInject the Regular Insulin dose of AIR into the vial. In this case  5 units.Now, you can invert the Regular Insulin vial and draw back ONLY the prescribed dose of Regular Insulin  5 units.Remove the needle from the Regular Insulin vial, and insert it BACK into the NPH vial.Draw back EXACTLY the prescribed dose of NPH Insulin. So in this case, thats 10 units, for a total of 15 units.Now you can remove the needle from the NPH vial and prepare to administer it to the patient.IF you arent administering it right away, recap it and LABEL the medication syringe with the drugs and doses, date/time and your initials.

This is to prevent cloudy insulin from entering the clear insulin bottle.    * Always do this procedure in the correct order, as shown in the following sequence.Roll the bottle of the cloudy insulin between your hands to mix it.Clean both bottle tops with an alcohol wipe.Pull back the plunger of the syringe to the dose of the long-acting (cloudy) insulin in this example 15 units.

Insulins also are classified by the timing of their action in your body  specifically, how quickly they start to act, when they have a maximal effect and how long they act. Insulin analogues have been developed because human insulins have limitations when injected under the skinRapid Acting Insulin Analogs (Insulin Aspart, insulin Lyspro, Insulin Glulisine) which have an onset of action of 5 to 15 minutes, peak effect in 1 to 2 hours and duration of action that lasts 4-6 hours. With all doses, large and small, the onset of action and the time to peak effect is similar, The duration of insulin action is, however, affected by the dose  so a few units may last 4 hours or less, while 25 or 30 units may last 5 to 6 hours. As a general rule, assume that these insulins have a duration of action of 4 hours.Regular Human Insulin which has an onset of action of 1/2 hour to 1 hour, peak effect in 2 to 4 hours, and a duration of action of 6 to 8 hours. The larger the dose of regular the faster the onset of action, but the longer the time to peak effect and the longer the duration of the effect.Long-acting insulin analogues (Insulin Glargine, Insulin Detemir) which have an onset of insulin effect in 1 1/2-2 hours. The insulin effect plateaus over the next few hours and is followed by a relatively flat duration of action that lasts 12-24 hours for insulin detemir and 24 hours for insulin glargine.Get in touch with the solution by just clicking following links- Facebook Group- https://www.facebook.com/groups/solutionpharamcyFacebook Page- https://www.facebook.com/pharmavideo/New channel (Pharmacy Dictionary) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt6OXVV_2oxf5DD0Mad6e9AInstagram- https://www.instagram.com/solutionpharmacy/E-Mail for official and other work - solutionpharmacy@gmail.comLinkedIn- http://linkedin.com/in/pushpendrakpatel#solutionpharmacy #Pharmacologyclass #Pharmacognosyvideos #GPATonlinetest #GPATclass #GPATvideos #B.Pharmacylectures",Solution- Pharmacy,https://www.youtube.com/UCnXt2toLLxXDDHGj2OR5_8A,674K subscribers

Ill explain what your glucose levels should be.Normally, your fasting glucose level should be between 75 and 85 mg/dL. This is equivalent to one teaspoon of sugar in all of your blood. Prediabetes level is 100-125 mg/dL, while diabetes is 126 or above. But when youre doing keto and intermittent fasting and fully adapted to running on ketones and fat, your blood sugar will range between 50-70 mg/dL. If you look online you might get scared about having hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) which typically begins at a level of 70 and below, and labelled severe at 54. You might think you need to start consuming carbs to bring your blood sugar back up. But dont worry, this isnt so. Your body is using ketones and fat and its need for sugar goes way down. The key is how you feel when your blood sugar is that low.Are you feeling shaky, dizzy, or craving sweets? Are you thirsty? Or do you have lots of energy and feel great? If you feel great that means your body has adapted to ketones and this is your new normal.But if youre doing keto and intermittent fasting and your blood sugar is going up, there are a couple of reasons why. Your insulin will drop because your low carb diet stops spiking it. Chances are you have insulin resistance, which will take a while to heal. While it heals your cells still have too-low insulin, which allows your blood sugar to rise. If youre concerned then you can exercise the extra blood sugar off. What about fasting insulin? You can get a test called HOMA-IR to check your level. Your doctor may need to special order it because many of them arent aware of this test. Its valuable because youll be able to see both your fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin levels to determine if you have insulin resistance. Unfortunately, theres really no agreement on the level that indicates insulin resistance. Some say its a value below 8 IU/mL; others claim a normal level is 10-20. I personally believe it should be below 5. Check the study below that compares your health risks with a score of 8 as compared to a score of 5 or below.Now you can tell whats normal blood sugar when youre intermittent fasting and doing keto!Dr Eric Berg DC Bio: Dr. Berg, age 55, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

The amount of glucose expression depends on two factors. One is the bodys ability to metabolise, so the form we take it; whether it is a solid or liquid form. Second is whether it contains simple sugars or it contains complex sugars, fats and proteins. If it contains simple sugars the blood glucose levels after 30 minutes can range from 100 to 200 or sometimes up to 250. If we take foods that is rich in complex carbohydrate, fibre content and fat then the glucose expression is not very high. It may just reach around 100 to 140 or 160. So if you take a fruit juice or simple sugar drink or eat foods like white rice or potato then the sugar levels will surely go high.

Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.Polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, is a common HORMONAL disorder affecting about 10% of all women of reproductive age. PCOS is diagnosed when AT LEAST 2 of the following symptoms are present:- IRregular periods due to MISSED ovulation. - excess male hormone (androgen) as evidenced by lab tests or physical signs, such as excess facial and body, severe acne, and baldness. - presence of numerous small fluid-filled cysts in the ovaries which can be seen as dark circles on an ultrasound image. This is the symptom that originally gave the condition its name but is NOT always present in PCOS patients.PCOS is highly heritable, but the inheritance pattern is complex, with multiple genetic factors implicated in the susceptibility to the disease. While the exact cause of PCOS is unknown, disturbances in a number of hormones are thought to be responsible. PCOS patients usually have EXCESS luteinizing hormone, LH, together with a relatively LOW level of follicle-stimulating hormone, FSH, and increased levels of insulin. An ovary contains hundreds of thousands of IMMATURE eggs, each of these is enclosed in a structure called a follicle. Each month, a number of these follicles develop, compete with each other; and one of them survives and gives rise to a MATURE egg that is released during ovulation. Follicle development is mediated by FSH, a pituitary hormone. In PCOS patients, FSH deficiency results in ARREST of follicular maturation: the follicles stop halfway through their development and become cysts. IMPAIRED follicular development means NO mature egg produced or released, hence the ABSENCE of ovulation.Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas and is necessary for consumption of blood glucose by the bodys cells. INcreased insulin level in PCOS patients is a result of the body compensatory response to insulin RESISTANCE associated with PCOS. Excess insulin, together with high levels of luteinizing hormone, induce and maintain overproduction of androgen by the ovaries. Common complications of PCOS include: infertility, miscarriage or premature birth, type 2 diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, mood disorders, and endometrial cancer.While the choice of treatment may depend on the patients individual concerns, treating insulin resistance is generally recommended for all women with PCOS. Life style changes such as exercise, dieting and weight loss, and medications such as metformin, can LOWER both insulin and androgen levels, thus reducing the risks of type 2 diabetes, and improving ovulation. Patients who want to get pregnant may also be prescribed anti-estrogen medications such as clomiphene.  On the other hand, when fertility is not the goal of treatment, hormonal birth control, a combination of estrogen and progestin, is usually prescribed to regulate the menstrual cycle and reduce risks of endometrial cancer.",Alila Medical Media,https://www.youtube.com/UCiTGKA9W0G0TL8Hm7Uf_u9A,833K subscribers

They all remain at  6 to  7  mm itself. Normally one of the follicles  will dominate  to grow and route  to release the egg. In Polycystic ovaries that is  not  happening.

The most common symptom of polycystic ovaries is irregular periods. Patients will skip periods for weeks or months at a time. They will go into 45 days, beyond 45 days, 3 months, 6 months at a time that they'll skip periods. Then when they have them they can be fairly heavy. It's also a disease process where we think insulin resistance plays a role. We see some abnormal hair growth. We see some skin changes associated with it; we see acne. So there's a variety of different symptoms that can present that may help in recognizing that there might be a problem. Certainly if you're not ovulating and triggering a period, then it also can be difficult to attain a pregnancy because you have less opportunities in a year's time to get pregnant. It is estimated right now upwards of 15% of women in the United States probably have some variety of polycystic ovaries. It's a large number, and I think that's consistent with what I see in my practice. For the most part polycystic ovaries is not dangerous to people; it's a problem that needs to be managed. If someone has irregular periods and have some of these other symptoms, they should see their gynecologist and have a discussion about trying to determine what is the cause of their irregular periods The old adage of, Oh I didn't get my period, I must have been stressed, is really not an accurate assessment of the situation. If someone is regularly skipping periods, they should be seen by a physician and evaluated. If left untreated over years and years it is a problem that that can give people more issues down the road. These could include premature coronary disease, a pre-symptom of diabetes, and risk of endometrial cancer. Because of this discussion and understanding of the disease process between the patient and the physician is very important. The treatment really is management of the ill effects of the disease process. For example if one of the problems is insulin resistance, then certainly changing diet and exercise and weight-loss can decrease the chance that someone might develop diabetes down the road. The regulation of cycles through a variety of medications can prevent the risk of endometrial cancer overtime. The easiest and best way to probably try to reverse some of the effects of polycystic ovaries is through diet and weight loss.

Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.Chronic kidney disease, CKD, is a gradual loss of renal function, typically developing over the course of months or years. Many conditions, both within and outside the kidneys, can cause progressive damage to the kidneys over time, leading to CKD. Of these, most common are diabetes and hypertension, both of which directly damage blood vessels within the kidney, destroying renal tissue. An acute kidney injury, if not completely resolved, may also become chronic kidney disease. The severity of renal disease is evaluated based on glomerular filtration rate, GFR, an indicator of how well the blood is filtered by the kidneys. GFR is calculated as a function of serum creatinine, a waste product that accumulates in blood plasma when renal function declines. The calculation takes into account the patients age, gender and race.Symptoms develop slowly over time, progressing from renal insufficiency to end-stage renal failure. Often, initial loss of renal tissue does not produce any symptoms, because the remaining healthy tissue becomes more active and can temporarily compensate for the loss, a phenomenon known as renal adaptation. Symptoms appear when a significant portion of kidney function is already lost. The ability to concentrate urine is usually the first to be impaired, resulting in frequent trips to the bathroom, especially at night. Other early signs include fatigue, loss of appetite, and decreased mental ability. Because the kidneys remove metabolic wastes, control blood pH and fluid/electrolyte balance, as well as produce several hormones, loss of kidney function may result in a number of complications:- Accumulation of toxic nitrogenous wastes can cause a range of symptoms, from nausea, vomiting to confusion and seizures. - Reduced excretion of hydrogen ions leads to increased blood acidity, or metabolic acidosis. - Reduced excretion of potassium results in potassium overload in the blood, or hyperkalemia, which may cause cardiac arrhythmias. Hyperkalemia usually occurs only in advanced stage, but excessive potassium intake or use of drugs that prevent potassium excretion, may precipitate the condition in earlier stages.- Decreased excretion of phosphate results in hyperphosphatemia. - Reduced renal production of calcitriol, an active form of vitamin D, contributes to low blood calcium level, or hypocalcemia. Low blood calcium stimulates production of parathyroid hormone, PTH, by the parathyroid gland. PTH promotes calcium release from bones in an attempt to raise blood calcium. This sequence eventually leads to an overactive parathyroid gland, or secondary hyperparathyroidism, which can develop before hypocalcemia occurs. As the bones continuously lose calcium to the blood, they become thin and weakened, a condition known as renal osteodystrophy. Symptoms include bone and joint pain, and increased risks of fractures. - Reduced renal secretion of erythropoietin, a stimulating factor for red blood cell formation, can lead to anemia.Diagnosis is based on renal function tests, which include blood and urine analysis. Ultrasound is performed to detect renal obstruction. It may also help in distinguishing chronic kidney disease from acute kidney injury based on kidney size.Treatments aim to control the underlying condition, address the complications, and involve certain nutrition supplements and restrictions. End-stage kidney disease requires dialysis or kidney transplantation.",Alila Medical Media,https://www.youtube.com/UCiTGKA9W0G0TL8Hm7Uf_u9A,833K subscribers

It was originally created to help people with diabetes select foods to improve their glycemic control by ranking foods as low, medium, or high GI. You cant just guess the GI of a food by looking at a food label, it has to be tested. To express the impact of a particular food, we need a reference to compare it to. 50g of pure sucrose requires little digestion so the glucose can be rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream. Ive fasted for over 12 hours and I havent had any physical activity this morning, so I can drink my pure sugar drink. Im using a continuous glucose monitor to measure my blood glucose every 5 minutes. And now Im going to sit tight for 2 hours so we can see the impact on my blood glucose. So its the next day and now we can do an experiment to determine the glycemic index of a particular test food. Im going to test this Daves Killer Bread the 21 whole grains and seeds version. We want to compare like to like. Today Im going to eat a serving of bread that also gives me 50 grams of digestible carbohydrate. And that word digestible is actually pretty important, because of fiber, which is also a carbohydrate but we cant actually digest it. We have to actually subtract the fiber from the total carbohydrates in the product. When I look at the nutrition facts panel, what I see is that one slice of bread has 22 grams of carbohydrates in it, but 5 of those grams are fiber. If I want to get 50 grams total then I need to eat almost three whole slices of bread. Okay, so here I have 50 grams of digestible carbohydrate of Daves Killer Seed bread. In this graph we see my blood glucose to the sugar drink in red and to the bread in blue. Its pretty striking how different they are over these two hours! The bread caused a much more gradual rise in blood glucose, and the peak was substantially lower compared to the sugar drink. Now to actually calculate the glycemic index, we need to calculate the area under the curve for both the sugar drink and the bread separately. Then we divide the bread test food area by the sugar drink reference and multiply by 100 to express it as a percent. Using this method, the glycemic index for Daves Killer Seed bread is 34, which puts it in the low GI category. From this n of one experiment, we observed that Daves Killer Seed bread raises my blood glucose only 34% as much as the sugar drink over a two hour period. I was actually pretty surprised at how low the GI for this bread was. I definitely expected it to be lower than the sugar drink due to the fiber content, since fiber slows down the absorption of glucose, but I really didnt think that it would be categorized as a low GI food because its still bread! And the reality is, it might not be! We cant exactly conclude that the GI of Daves Killer Seed Bread is for sure 34 just from this experiment - determining the GI of a food needs to be done in a larger sample of study participants than just me, and each participant needs to do the experiment in duplicate or triplicate, meaning drinking the sugar drink on three separate days and eating the test food on three separate days. Usually that sugar drink is made of pure glucose rather that the sucrose table sugar. It also turns out that theres a few more complications about the glycemic index and its applicability.",Nourishable,https://www.youtube.com/UCZd2F5-qowTdfb_gyPHUTRQ,17.1K subscribers

Glycemic Index  is nothing  but  the  measure  or the ranking of  foods from 1 to 100 depending on how they affect our  blood  glucose  levels. Foods are typically ranked as high, medium and low depending on how they are utilised,  absorbed and released as glucose in the body. based on the glucose  release, our  body secretes insulin,  which is necessary to carry the glucose  into the  cells which is necessary  to provide  us  with the energy to the cells. So we should always include foods that release glucose  slowly  into the blood stream so that  our  body  does not demand  too much of insulin at once. When there are frequent spikes of insulin secretions, or heavy meals at once or  highly  loaded sugary  foods then this can lead to diabetes or other    lifestyle disorders.  High glycemic index  foods  are those  with the ranking of   more than 70 and must be  reduced as much as  possible. These are foods such as polished rice, refined breads, dates, honey, sugars, cornflakes and a lot of other  processed foods.  Low glycemic index foods release glucose slowly and regulates the insulin secretion and decreases the risk of diabetes or any lifestyle disorders.  Most fruits and vegetables are relatively  low  or moderate on GI and must be regulated. however for  better health we may have not included  some amount of  high  GI food s  such as  dates, raisins, water melons and  potatoes and cannot be ignored  so we cannot include them at teh right time with the right  combination of foods. So we should balance the intake with healthy combination of foods after considering their glycaemic  index. Processed foods, refined foods and packed foods definitely contains high glycemic Index and shod be avoided for good health.",Doctors' Circle - World's Largest Health Platform,https://www.youtube.com/UCJY1JCVsIgVgN5ePERZ_Upg,1.43 million subscribers

So it's if you have one specific amount, how quickly does that elevate your blood sugar and get converted into glucose. So for example, glucose is 100. It's the highest point that you can get to. So for example, wheat bread is a 75. Carrots are a 40. Broccoli is a 15. And eggs are a zero. That's just how you measure sort of the carbohydrate glucose density of something.So The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition published a study that was done out of Harvard. Took a look at 12 men, gave them nearly identical meals. So literally they ate the same meal, same calories, the same macronutrients, same proteins, fats and carbs. The only difference was the glycemic index was 37 in one group, and was 84 in another. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23803881So high glycemic versus low glycemic. The participants didn't even know their food was different. Now what they found is that the high glycemic index caused a big blood sugar spike and then a strong dip below baseline three hours later. But when they looked at their brains under fMRI, they found that the nucleus accumbens was lit up like a Christmas tree. The nucleus accumbens is the part that is associated with addiction. So we definitely saw that even when food tastes the same, higher glycemic index will make you more addicted to it. So that's why you want to avoid high glycemic foods. You want to go low GI, even if it's comparable foods otherwise.Now what's glycemic load? See, people interchange them and they get them mixed up. Glycemic load is how much a non-fixed amount affects your blood glucose. So again, it's basically our glycemic index multiplied by how much you eat. So we use that same example of wheat bread. Wheat bread is, no matter what, going to be a 75. Whether you eat one piece of wheat bread or a hundred pieces of wheat bread, it's still the same glycemic index. It still spikes your blood sugar at the same rate of speed. But glycemic load ends up factoring in how much of it there is. So in this case, wheat bread times two, still 75 GI, but two times the load.The best way to compare it is like caloric density. We look at one piece of food compared to another and we say, oh, well that's more calorically dense than the other. So a simple thing it'd be like a square of butter might have just as many calories as an entire steak. But it's because the butter is more calorically dense than the steak. So it's all about balancing this glycemic index and this glycemic load. So when you look at glycemic load at that number, you want to understand, well, how much of this food is making how much of an impact in my body. So you should always look at glycemic index and glycemic load because this can carry you over for a longer period of time.Nicholas Norwitz - Oxford Ketone PhD Researcher and Harvard Med Student: https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/team/nicholas-norwitz",0,0,0

The glycemic index is a method used to categorize foods based on how they impact your blood glucose. The way this works is the blood glucose response to a test food, say this whole wheat bread, is measured over two hours, and its compared to the blood glucose response for a reference food, like a sugar drink. Based on these comparisons, foods can be categorized as low GI, meaning that they dont raise your blood glucose much, medium GI, or high GI, meaning that they raise your blood glucose alot. So it follows that if you want to avoid high spikes in blood glucose that you should avoid high GI foods, right? Well, its a bit more complicated than that, because heres the thing - the method for determining the glycemic index requires eating 50 grams of digestible carbohydrate - so thats 50 grams of sucrose in the sugar drink, or 50 grams of carbs minus the fiber in the whole wheat bread. And depending on the test food, sometimes 50 grams of carbs is a WAY bigger serving size than youd ever reasonably eat in a sitting. When I did my GI experiment with Daves Killer Seed Bread (not an ad, just a fan), I had to eat three full slices to get 50 grams of digestible carbs. This conundrum is even more striking with watermelon. Id need to eat 4.5 cups of watermelon to get 50 grams of digestible carbs - thats nearly an entire watermelon! Previous studies have calculated the glycemic index of watermelon to be 76, which categorizes it as a high GI food. But if we want a tool to help predict glycemic responses in the real world, we need to take the typical serving sizes into consideration. Thats where glycemic load comes in. The glycemic load, or GL, is a ranking system that corrects the glycemic index for the number of carbohydrates in typical serving size. To calculate the GL, you multiply the number of digestible carbs in a serving by the GI and divide by 100. We know that watermelon has a high GI of 76, but its mostly water! A typical 100g serving of watermelon has 7g of digestible carbs. To calculate the GL we take that 7 gram serving of carbs multiplied by the GI of 76 and divide by 100 to give us a GL of 5. Foods are categorized into low, medium, or high GL. where a lower GL means a serving of food raises your blood glucose less. This categorizes watermelon as a low glycemic load food - so a typical serving size wont cause a huge spike in blood glucose. Overall, the glycemic load is a better reflection of expected blood glucose responses to foods based on how much we usually eat in one sitting. That makes it more useful than the glycemic index. There are still some more complications with the applicability of the glycemic load in the real world, and I dig into them in my glycemic responses video series.",Nourishable,https://www.youtube.com/UCZd2F5-qowTdfb_gyPHUTRQ,17.1K subscribers

Typically, on keto, you want to keep your carb intake between twenty and fifty grams per day. But its very important to look at the type of carb youre consuming. For background, Ill define two things. The first is the glycemic index, which measures how fast the glucose is spiked in your blood. The second is the glycemic load, which is a measure of the quantity of carbohydrates in a particular food item. And its offset by fiber; so, if a certain food contains carbohydrates but most of it is fiber, that food would be on the low side.Lets compare a carrot and a potato. The glycemic index of a carrot is 72, which is fairly high. A potato has a glycemic index of 60 to 110. Its potentially lower than a carrot if the potato is boiled. But if you further mash it or otherwise break it down, the potatos score will go higher.The glycemic load of a boiled potato is 31, which is high. Anything over 20 is high. A carrots glycemic load is 3, which is very low. (Anything below 10 is low.) The potato has ten times the glycemic load, because of the fiber content of the carrot, which puts its load so low. Carrots are much safer!When you read food labels, be sure to check the sugar content along with the carb content. If the sugar content is low, chances are that food has a low glycemic load. When you eat food with a low glycemic load, its often due to its fiber content, and it wont cause your blood sugar to spike.Talk to a Dr. Berg Keto Consultant today and get the help you need on your journey.

Whats the difference between high glycemic and low glycemic foods? Why is this important? When you consume food, your body digests the food and absorbs it into your bloodstream as glucose, a form of sugar. The glycemic index ranks foods according to their effects on blood sugar level. High glycemic index foods tend to cause a rapid rise in your blood sugar level and cause it to remain elevated for a while. Low glycemic index foods tend to contain fiber. Fiber slows the rate at which you digest and absorb your foods, therefore, your rises in blood sugar are much more modest. In general, incorporating low glycemic index foods into your diet can steer you towards healthier food choices.Learn More: https://iamherbalifenutrition.comConnect With Us Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Herbalife/Twitter: https://twitter.com/HerbalifeInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/herbalife/",Herbalife Nutrition,https://www.youtube.com/UC5fkkiImyfs93wwOLbC0FGA,598K subscribers

Healthy Habits: https://facebook.com/healthyhabits99============================Summary:10 low Glycemic Index Foods to Prevent Blood Sugar Spikes that are good for diabetes patients1. TomatoesTomatoes have a low GI ranking. 5 ounces of tomato has a GI of less than 15, which is low. Eating a tomato will raise blood sugar and insulin levels gradually rather than rapidly.2. Sour CherriesThe glycemic index of fresh sour cherries is 22, considered as a low GI food. This makes sour cherries can be safely eaten on a diabetes diet and are unlikely to significantly raise blood sugar levels. Fresh sweet cherries rank 62 on the GI scale, making them a medium GI food. 3. Leafy GreensPeople with diabetes should eat vegetables with a low GI score to avoid blood sugar spikes. Low-GI vegetables are also safe for people with diabetes, such as asparagus, broccoli, lettuce, green bean, kale, spinach, and celery. 4. AvocadosThe Glycemic Index of avocado is 14 which falls under the low GI category. Avocados contain primarily polyunsaturated fatty acids (Pufas) and monounsaturated fatty acids (Mufas). These fats are ""good fats"". They can actually improve insulin sensitivity, improve blood pressure, reduce inflammation, and increase feelings of satiety after eating.Avocados are high in fiber, which can help in the slow absorption of nutrients and thus manages blood glucose levels. they are also low in carbohydrates, which means they have little effect on blood sugar levels. 5. GarlicGarlic is very tasty yet has no carbohydrates, so it doesnt feature on the glycemic index at all. You can use garlic to flavor your meals without worrying about a blood sugar spike.Some studies show that taking moderate amounts of garlic (at least one clove or equivalent daily) when you have type 2 diabetes, can improve insulin sensitivity and help regulate your blood sugar levels. 6. EggsEggs have a glycemic index score of zero. They do not have the potential to raise your blood glucose levels.A study suggests that regularly eating eggs could improve fasting blood glucose in people with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.7. Blueberries And BlackberriesBlueberries and blackberries have GI scores of about 40 but are still well within the range of low glycemic foods. The nutrients and phytonutrients in berries appear to limit glucose absorption and to help reduce insulin resistance.8. Fish With Omega-3 Fatty AcidsOmega-3 fatty acids in fish have been found to increase levels of a hormone called adiponectin which improves insulin sensitivity and lowers the risk of developing full-blown diabetes.9. Almonds And Other NutsMost nuts all have low GI scores, between 0 and 20. The GI score for almonds is estimated to be zero. Almonds are especially good for a diabetes diet because they have been found to regulate blood sugar, limit spikes after meals and prevent diabetes. Almonds may also be able to increase insulin sensitivity in prediabetics.10. Chia SeedsChia seeds are high in fiber and healthy fat, plus antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, protein and calcium. Chia seeds seem to slow glucose passage into the blood. They fill you up and so reduce appetite. That's all about 10 best Low GI food for diabetes for your consideration.  #lowglycemicfoods#top10lowgifoods#lowgifoods#lowgifoodsfordiabetes#preventbloodsugarspike=====================================  DISCLAIMER : The material in this video is provided for educational and informational purposes only.

When doctors write you a prescription, you shouldnt have to worry about cancer risks or any other issues that could harm your health. But, not all medications were created equal. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first class of incretin mimetic drugs in 2006. However, since at least 2009 the drugs have been under scrutiny for a possible link to pancreatic cancer.There continues to be an ongoing debate as to whether or not incretin mimetics are safe. Studies continue to find a link between the use of incretins and increased pancreatic cancer risks.Further, in 2013, the FDA began investigating findings from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The Johns Hopkins studies suggest that incretins lead to an increased risk of:PancreatitisPre-cancerous cellular changes (pancreatic duct metaplasia)Pancreatic cancerA year after the FDAs announcement, both the FDA and the EMA came to the conclusion that while there still wasnt nearly enough data to rule that incretins led to pancreatic cancer, the drugs would carry a warning label for pancreatitis.Learn more here - https://www.carlsonattorneys.com/news-and-update/incretin-mimetic-drugsWhat are Incretin Mimetics?Incretin Mimetics are a group of drugs to treat Type 2 diabetes. Januvia, Victoza, Janumet, and Byetta are oral prescription pills or injectable medications used to help lower a diabetic patients glucose levels. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Januvia in 2006, and Janumet in 2007. Drugs in the incretin mimetic class include the following:ByettaBydureonVictozaJanuviaJanumetJanumet XRJuvisynOnglyzaKombiglyze XRNesinaKazanoOseniTradjentaJentaduetoThese drugs work by mimicking the incretin hormones that the body naturally produces to stimulate the release of insulin in response to a meal. Along with diet and exercise, these medications lower blood sugar in adults living with type 2 diabetes.The Carlson Law Firm is currently investigating pancreatic cancer in diabetic patients who used incretin mimetics. Hundreds have taken legal action against pharmaceutical companies for these dangerous drugs. If you or someone you love suffered injuries from Januvia, Janumet, Byetta or Victoza, contact our firm.

The majority of glucose is spared for tissues with an absolute requirement for it, such as the brain.So with muscle tissue refusing the glucose in order to keep it available for the brain, the blood glucose rises, especially first thing in the morning - due to the dawn phenomenon.When you are sleeping your body is very active cleaning out the brain and rebalancing hormones to prepare you for the next day.Early in the morning, the body releases cortisol, epinephrine, growth hormone, and glucagon - these hormones all have the effect of increasing blood sugar to wake you up.The difference in those who are following a ketogenic lifestyle is that if they are well keto-adapted, then their cells may refuse to burn that sugar for energy, which can make fasting blood sugar levels be more elevated than usual.Simply, dawn phenomenon is a natural rise in blood sugar because of a surge of hormones secreted at night which trigger your liver to dump sugar into your blood to help prepare you for the day.In Depth:So physiological insulin resistance is actually quite logical as muscle runs well on lipids and so glucose can be left for tissues such as brain, which really need it.Neuronal tissue varies in its use of insulin to uptake glucose but doesn't accumulate lipid in the way muscle does, so physiological insulin resistance is not an issue for brain cells.However, while muscles are in ""refusal mode"" for glucose the least input, from food or gluconeogenesis, will rapidly spike blood glucose.Instead of sugar not being able to get into the cells due to insulin resistance, the cells are simply refusing to burn sugar because they would prefer the ketones already being used.So after going low carb, your muscle tissue becomes insulin resistant in order to preserve serum glucose availability for the brain. If your muscle tissue did not do this, reduced availability of glucose in the serum could (theoretically) put you in dire straights if your brain cant meet minimal demand for glucose. In other words, physiological insulin resistance is a protective response of the body that ensures that the brain gets the benefit of a limited supply of glucose.Because the rest of the body is refusing to take up glucose, and the liver takes it up slowly, a meal of carbohydrates is followed by higher blood glucose levels in someone on a low carbohydrate diet.http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/304/3/994.long1) physiology.org | Error.

It was a formula created by Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet. It takes your weight (sorry my fellow Americans, everyone else is on the metric system) in kilograms divides and divides it by height in meters squared. And from this you get a number that represent your total body mass relative to your height and weight. The ranges go from underweight to obese, and one decimal point can tip you in either direction. BMI has been used to study obesity in large populations, and for the most part its okay for those types of studies. However, when individual health is the topic at hand, using the body mass index can make judging a persons health a little bit trickier.See the state of obesity in your area:https://stateofobesity.org/adult-obesity/CDCs BMI considerations for practitioners:https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/downloads/bmiforpactitioners.pdfAnd to check Marshawn Lynchs stats visit:https://www.playerprofiler.com/nfl/marshawn-lynch/http://www.nfl.com/player/marshawnlynch/2495663/combineSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjOVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

And a high bmi can increase a persons risk for certain diseases.It is calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing it by your height in meters squared.Bmi = kg/msqIf you are using pounds for weight and feet or inches for height, then we need to do some conversions. Lets say someone is 175 pounds and 5 foot 9.To convert pounds to kilograms,1 pound equals 0.4536 kilograms, so, you multiply by 0.4536, so 175 pounds, times 0.4536 equals 79.38 kilograms.To convert feet to meters, first convert feet to inches.  12 inches in a foot, so 5 times 12 equals 60 inches, plus 9 inches equals a total of 69 inches.  1 inch equals 0.0254 meters, so multiply by 0.0254, so 69 times 0.0254 equals 1.7526 meters.Now we have all that we need for the formula.  79.38 kilograms divided by 1.7526 meters squared equals a bmi of 25.8.And here is the formula for bmi using common US metrics of pounds and inches.Here is a chart listing weight status that I got from the cdc website, based on bmi.  As you see, anything below 18.5 is considered underweight and anything over 30 is considered obese.  And here is a bmi chart listing various weights and heights and the classifications of the bmis.One thing to consider is that someone that has more muscle may fall into an overweight classification.And, in 2014 the average bmi in the united states was 28.5 for both men and women.Timestamps0:00 BMI (body mass index) definition0:09 Formula for BMI0:20 How to convert pounds to kilograms0:36 How to convert inches to meters1:10 Formula for BMI in pounds and inches1:26 BMI chart",Whats Up Dude,https://www.youtube.com/UCG7WdmLGzacESLc9DMyZb-A,152K subscribers

A high BMI ( greater than 25 overweight, greater than 30 obese) is associated with a myriad of health risks BMI has two major limitations. It's accuracy varies by race and is limited in individuals with lean muscle mass.Body mass index, also known as BMI, is an objective way to describe someones height and weight. Overweight and obese BMI are associated with a ton of diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and strokes.Research has shown that in individuals with a BMI over 25 (classified as overweight) and a BMI over 30 (classified as obese) the risks for the following conditions also increases:Death from any cause (all cause mortality)Coronary heart disease (heart attack)Type 2 diabetesCancers (endometrial, breast, and colon)Hypertension (high blood pressure)Dyslipidemia (high cholesterol, triglycerides)Stroke (cerebrovascular accident)Liver and Gallbladder diseaseSleep apnea and respiratory problemsOsteoarthritis (a degeneration of cartilage and its underlying bone within a joint)Gynecological problems (abnormal menses, infertility)Metabolic syndrome",Lifestyle Medicine,https://www.youtube.com/UClT_n6c98KrXSJq944cBHZA,28.9K subscribers

What does BODY MASS INDEX mean? BODY MASS INDEX meaning - BODY MASS INDEX definition - BODY MASS INDEX explanation.Source: Wikipedia.org article, adapted under https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ license.The body mass index (BMI) or Quetelet index is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of an individual. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.The BMI may also be determined using a table or chart which displays BMI as a function of mass and height using contour lines or colours for different BMI categories, and which may use other units of measurement (converted to metric units for the calculation).The BMI is an attempt to quantify the amount of tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) in an individual, and then categorize that person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on that value. However, there is some debate about where on the BMI scale the dividing lines between categories should be placed. Commonly accepted BMI ranges are underweight: under 18.5 kg/m2, normal weight: 18.5 to 25, overweight: 25 to 30, obese: over 30. People of Asian descent have different associations between BMI, percentage of body fat, and health risks than those of European descent, with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease at BMIs lower than the WHO cut-off point for overweight, 25 kg/m2, although the cutoff for observed risk varies among different Asian populations.BMI is proportional to the mass and inversely proportional to the square of the height. So, if all body dimensions double, and mass scales naturally with the cube of the height, then BMI doubles instead of remaining the same. This results in taller people having a reported BMI that is uncharacteristically high, compared to their actual body fat levels. In comparison, the Ponderal index is based on the natural scaling of mass with the third power of the height.However, many taller people are not just ""scaled up"" short people but tend to have narrower frames in proportion to their height. Nick Korevaar (a mathematics lecturer from the University of Utah) suggests that instead of squaring the body height (as the BMI does) or cubing the body height (as the Ponderal index does), it would be more appropriate to use an exponent of between 2.3 and 2.7 (as originally noted by Quetelet). (For a theoretical basis for such values see MacKay.) Carl Lavie has written that, ""The B.M.I. tables are excellent for identifying obesity and body fat in large populations, but they are far less reliable for determining fatness in individuals.""A frequent use of the BMI is to assess how much an individual's body weight departs from what is normal or desirable for a person's height.

A BMI of 26 to 30 is considered overweight. A BMI of 31 to 35 is the first part of obesity so we call it Obesity 1, 35 to 40 is Obesity 2, and when you hit 40 and above, we call it Morbid Obesity.

Then multiply that number times 703. That gives you your body mass index. If you fall between 18.5 and 24.9, you're considered to be a healthy weight. If you're 25 to 29.9, you're considered overweight. If you're 30 or higher, you're considered obese. If you're 40 or higher, you're considered extremely obese. ""A healthy weight is different for everybody. You want to be within your healthy weight. The BMI chart can help you get a good range of where you should be based on your height. It's different for everybody because some people are more muscular, some people are more lean, some people have more fat mass. There is a flexibility associated with it. If you're concerned about your weight, you should always talk to your doctor because they can give you an idea of where you should be. How much weight should you lose? Do you need to lose weight?""The easiest way to track your BMI is to keep track of your weight. Because most of the time, your height is not changing significantly. You might lose a little bit of inches as you age, but you go to the doctor every year and they measure you. You know how tall you are. I recommend weighing yourself about once a week, unless your doctor tells you you should do that more or less. If you can keep track of your weight and again, know where you're going.

And the normal reference range, or what we call the normal range, is based on clinical studies that tracked the risk of somebody developing a complication and compared the risk to the Body Mass Index and if I draw this, it is what we call a J shaped curve because actually if you are too thin it is not good, people who are very thin often have higher rates of risk of developing problems and then as the weight goes up there is an exponential increase in risk that occurs as your BMI goes up. But there is a little spot, right down the bottom, where the risk is at its lowest and that is how we define the normal reference range and for most people that is between 20-25. And so that is when we talk about ideal body weight it is ideal because it has the lowest rate of risk for things going wrong so we think that is the most positive place to be. But what happens to people who are significantly overweight?Perhaps their BMI is 30, so that is the definition of obese, or 35 or 40 and if you start to plot that group of people you can see that the risk becomes incredibly high for certain people, and the higher your Body Mass Index is the greater the risk.So people for example with a BMI of 40 have a risk that is really incredibly challenging. But the other interesting thing is that if you can reduce your Body Mass Index from say 40 down to 35 that is a substantial risk reduction. And if you can reduce it from 35 down to 30 that is still a substantial risk reduction but not as big as the person that has reduced their weight from a BMI of 40 down to 35. And if you go from 30 to 25 again there is further risk reduction but it is not as substantial. So whilst we talk to people about their ideal body weight and if they weigh 100kgs perhaps their ideal body weight might be 70kgs, in fact changing from 100 down to 90 has a profound effect because a person literally slides down the BMI curve. And in doing so has a massive risk reduction.So the trick with weight loss is not to think about what your ideal body weight isbecause that actually may be very difficult to achieve particularly if you are 30, 40, 50kgs above what you should be.The trick with weight reduction is to understand the benefits that you get by making small modest changes. And just if we look at something like diabetes if a person is able to lose about 10% of their body weight so if you weigh 110kgs then you are looking at 11kgs, that has a profound impact on how well your insulin works on your glucose control, and your cholesterol and your blood pressure. It is not about achieving perfection. It is about reducing risk as quickly and as effectively as possible in the most achievable way.",My Health Explained,https://www.youtube.com/UCJZc4FJs8Qfmw-r3xiO-mSA,9.21K subscribers

It is used to check whether we have a healthy weight according to our height. BMI is calculated by dividing a persons weight in kilograms with his height in meters squared. A BMI of 18.49 or below indicates that the person is underweight. 18.5 to 24.99 is considered as normal weight, 25 to 29.99 overweight and a BMI of 30 or more is considered as obese. Thus, BMI helps doctors to categorize our overall health. However, some experts think that this method is not accurate. This is because BMI doesnt distinguish between fat and muscle mass. So for example, if a person has more well-defined muscle mass and less fat levels, BMI will categorize him as obese. Also, a person having less muscle mass and more amount of harmful visceral fat maybe considered healthy by BMI.

With gangrene, the tissue in the toes or foot, and sometimes the hand, starts turning black, yellow, red, and sometimes even a shade of green. The word gangrene is derived from the Latin word that means putrefaction, or dead or dying tissue. And the reason the tissue is dying is that its being exposed to way too much sugar.When you expose your vascular system to too much glucose, it gets damaged. You get massive oxidation, creating free radicals. You experience hemorrhaging clotting and a thickened stiffened vascular system. All of this causes a healing response; an inflammatory response, and impairs the blood flow to your tissues and nerves.The lining of your vascular system is called the endothelial layer. It doesnt require insulin to transport glucose into the cells. This means if you have insulin resistance, you wont have the resistance in the endothelial layer. If theres too much glucose it will be driven right into your tissues, which is why so much damage is created. If you look at insulin resistance as a protective mechanism that prevents too much glucose and insulin from going into the tissues, its easy to see why tissues that dont need insulin to get battered. Brain tissue is another example, along with red blood cells. When you get an A1C test, whats measured is a level of exposure to sugar of the red blood cells, to determine whether or not youre a diabetic. The more sugar in your blood, the more vascular problems youll have. Itll stop both the nutrition and oxygen to your tissues, leading to gangrene. You may get a combination of gangrene, ulcers, and nerve damage. But heres what you can do. The most important thing is to avoid it in the first place, by not consuming so much sugar. Do keto and intermittent fasting. If you already have this condition there are a couple of things you can do depending on how severe it is. Believe it or not, in 2004 the FDA approved maggot therapy. Maggots are put into skin ulcers to clean up the dead tissue, and its very effective because it disinfects the area and stimulates healing. The maggots actually release enzymes and a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Of course, you also want to change your diet to lower your sugar intake.Now you know the answer to why do some diabetics get gangrene?Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio: Dr. Berg, age 55, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed when a patient has at least three of the following:- A waistline of 40 inches or more for men, or 35 inches or more for women; - A systolic blood pressure above 130 and a diastolic blood pressure above 85 mmHg, or if the patient is taking blood pressure-lowering medications; - A fasting blood sugar level above 100 mg/dL, or if the patient is taking glucose-lowering medications; - A triglyceride level greater than 150 mg/dL; - An HDL level of less than 40 mg/dL for men, or 50 mg/dLfor women.Metabolic syndrome, in turn, has its own set of underlying risk factors, of which insulin resistance is most important. Insulin resistance is when the bodys cells do not respond well to insulin and therefore cannot use glucose; glucose stays in the blood, causing high blood sugar levels while the cells are deprived of nutrition. Insulin resistance can be acquired, hereditary, or mixed. Other risk factors include abdominal obesity, physical inactivity, aging, hormonal imbalances, and use of certain medications. Women are more susceptible than men. Some racial and ethnic groups are at higher risk than others.Metabolic syndrome is often associated with excessive blood clotting and chronic low-grade inflammation, as well as several other conditions, but the cause-effect relationship is not clear.The goal of treating metabolic syndrome is to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Treatment aims to lower blood pressure and cholesterol; and to manage diabetes, or prevent it, if it hasnt already developed. Lifestyle changes include a heart-healthy diet, physical activity plan, weight management, stress management, and quitting smoking.  If lifestyle changes arent enough, medications may be prescribed to lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides; to reduce blood pressure, blood sugar level, or to prevent blood clots.",Alila Medical Media,https://www.youtube.com/UCiTGKA9W0G0TL8Hm7Uf_u9A,833K subscribers

Despite living in a body-conscious society, Americans are fatter than ever before. And its weighing heavily on our health.What we eat has changed so dramatically over the last 50 years and thats why were seeing a rise in obesity, diabetes and all these other metabolic problems, says Dr. Lacagnina. They key indicators are high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high bad cholesterol, low good cholesterol and belly fat. The more of these you have, the greater your health risk.Weve known for a long time that when you see patients with all of these abnormalities together, they significantly increase the risk more then they individually do, says Dr. Lacagnina. As doctors get a better understanding of metabolic syndrome, theyre learning to use the very same thing that causes it, to treat it: diet.You can effect your blood pressure right away, your blood sugar levels go down, your cholesterol level goes down and you start losing weight. So if were looking for one thing that will make a difference in the whole metabolic syndrome, just changing your diet, says Dr. Lacagnina. A calculation of risk, metabolic syndrome can be a turning point - to take notice, change habits and get healthy.

This is also known as syndrome X.Metabolic syndrome is a combination of several health problems, including: High lipids High blood sugar Insulin resistance or diabetes  High blood pressure Obesity I want to talk about why metabolic syndrome should really be called hyperinsulinemia syndrome. The convention viewpoint on this is that insulin resistance leads to increased insulinis that true? Or is the high insulin that causes insulin resistance? To figure this out, all we have to do is observe what happens after a gastric bypasswhere they bypass part of the small intestine. The small intestine affects insulin production. As it turns out, a gastric bypass reduces high insulin. In turn, this reduces type 2 diabetes by 83%. It also reduces high blood pressure by 63% and reduces high cholesterol by 61%. All of these are what make up syndrome X or metabolic syndrome. Additionally, gastric bypass improves sleep apnea, PCOS, fatty liver, GERD, and joint pain. If you lower insulin, you produce a massive amount of change across the board with your healthincluding many issues associated with metabolic syndrome. When you have high insulin over a period of time, the body starts to resist it. In turn, this raises insulin more, which also causes more insulin resistance. Its a vicious cycle, but only if you continue to have poor dietary habits, like: Frequent eating Consuming too many carbohydrates Consuming too much sugarMost doctors just dont connect these dots.Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio:Dr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

Metabolic syndrome is a collection of several conditions including high blood pressure, belly fat, and high blood sugar and cholesterol. Other countries besides the US specify a couple of additional conditions as part of metabolic syndrome.If you look up something called hyperinsulinemia (high insulin), youll probably find information stating its associated with metabolic syndrome. But really, high insulin causes metabolic syndrome.For example, a Wikipedia entry about high insulin describes it as having a close association with metabolic syndrome that suggest or relate a common mechanism of pathology. This just confuses people! When you get fat, you develop insulin resistance, but to initially gain weight it was high insulin that got you there. Insulin increases the synthesis of fatty acid from glucose. In other words, insulin turns glucose into fat. As well, it inhibits the breakdown of fat. Insulin causes obesity. Pretty clear, right?High insulin may lead to diabetes, high cholesterol, hypertension, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and weight gain, the Wikipedia entry further states. Treatment is typically achieved via diet and exercisea low carbohydrate diet is effective in reducing hyperinsulinemia. I was waiting for the recommendation to eat a low-carb diet!But, in the end, theres an emphasis on eating soy. But soybean oil promotes the conditions associated with metabolic syndrome. However, food manufacturing companies, and the chemical companies behind them, pull a lot of strings  so of course, its in their interest for you to eat soy. Now you know that metabolic syndrome is purely caused by high insulin. Dr. Eric Berg DC Bio: Dr. Berg, age 56, is a chiropractor who specializes in Healthy Ketosis & Intermittent Fasting.

She monitors her glucose, but when it came to the state of her feet, Pat was unfeeling. About half of diabetics have this side effect called neuropathy.""These patients, especially when they get really bad, lose the ability to feel their feet. So they don't know when there's a problem,"" says Dr. Andrew Belis, foot and ankle surgeon on staff with Lee Memorial Health System. Diabetic neuropathy is nerve damage brought on by uncontrolled blood sugar. The feet and toes are most commonly affected. The lack of sensation increases the risk of serious problems when injuries and sores go unnoticed.That's exactly what happened to Schulkins.""It was like a big blister kind of, inward though. It wasn't sticking out like a blister does,"" says Schulkins. By the time she noticed the ulcer on her foot, it was almost too late to save.""The ulcer was there and it was chronic and resistant to care. And we got to change courses and address the underlining bone structure, so we basically reconstructed her foot so there's not these high pressure spots where the ulcer or the bone would break through the skin,"" says Dr. Belis. Experts stress the importance of knowing the symptoms, which may include, tingling, burning, pain or numbness in the feet; getting annual foot exams and wearing approved diabetic shoes if needed.""Even simple things like an ingrown nail can get infected; it can get down to the bone and can risk losing the toe. You or I notice a sore or even a small cut on your foot people with diabetes have less feeling they may not notice it until two or three weeks later. By that point it could have erupted into a full blown infection,"" says Dr. Belis. Although she managed to side step an amputation, Schulkins will never take her feet for granted.""And I know, I never thought it would happen,"" says Schulkins.

Dr. Todd Hobbs, the companys U.S. chief medical officer, said he is confident the new diabetes drug will live up to the early hype. 'The long acting duration of action is something unique,' said Hobbs. 'Its going to offer patients flexibility that they dont have with current products and we are real excited to have that in the U.S. now.' Tresiba is already sold in 30 countries, and Novo Nordisk, already the worlds largest insulin maker, expects to launch it in the U.S. in early 2016. The U.S. approval means Novo Nordisk will be competing with against long-acting insulins Lantus and Toujeo sold by rival Sanofi SA (SNY). Tresiba is indicated for use alone, or in combination with oral antidiabetic medicines or bolus insulin, and is approved for glycemic control in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, according to Hobbs. He said Tresiba provides a long duration of action beyond 42 hours. While patients are encouraged to take their insulin at the same time each day, Hobbs said Tresiba allows patients to dose at any time of the day which is different from its current product in the market Levemir.Subscribe to TheStreetTV on YouTube:   http://t.st/TheStreetTVFor more content from TheStreet visit: http://thestreet.comCheck out all our videos: http://youtube.com/user/TheStreetTVFollow TheStreet on Twitter: http://twitter.com/thestreetLike TheStreet on Facebook: http://facebook.com/TheStreetFollow TheStreet on LinkedIn: http://linkedin.com/company/theStreetFollow TheStreet on Google+: http://plus.google.com/+TheStreet",TheStreet,https://www.youtube.com/UCp6aBHRM6ZS_kLeC57HV4kg,98.7K subscribers

PT3M3S,CCBEfQjf9NY,Lag Baomer Experience at Meron Come Full Circle,11503,2017-05-09,,56,0.0,"This is a story of a man who had a special connection to the Kever of Reb Shimon Bar Yochai on Lag Baomer, 30 years after visiting this holy site he learned of Tehillimkollel.org, at the time he had 5 children who were older singles and would do anything to find them a shidduch. So he jumped at the chance to send his 5 children to learn. Within months 3 of them were engaged!  Tefillah has such a huge power, but sometimes we don't see the results right away, we have to stay strong, Daven, and have Bitachon that Hashem will guide us in the right way.To learn more about the tehillim Kollel you can visit http://www.tehillimkollel.org/Fifteen thriving branches.Hundreds of completed Sefer Tehillims each week.Thousands of subscribers.All demonstrating the power of Tehillim.Years ago, R Mordechai Friedman, the Rosh Kollel of Tehillim Kollel, was just a young boy. One day, he was learning the sefer of the Shlah Hakadosh and he came along a story that changed his life. The Shlah tells of a town in which lived a very simple man who recited Tehillim every single day. His town folk didnt recognize his Tzidkus, as they didnt find the recitation of Tehillim to be a remarkable endeavor. When this simple man was niftar, he came to the Rav of the town in a dream with a dire warning, Rebbi, you must evacuate the town! Tomorrow night, there will be a massacre here. Robbers will come, loot homes, and kill everyone. Since I have been saying Tehillim every day, I have provided the town with protection, but now that I am gone, the townspeople are in severe danger! The Rav took this dream very seriously, gathered his community, and told them to pack up their belongings and run to a safe place. Many townspeople listened, but there were those who didnt, thinking such a simple man couldnt have protected their town and that the message couldnt be true. Sadly, those who stayed behind were killed that night.This young boy was astounded by the story and the clear power of Tehillim that it represented. He immediately took it upon himself to say Tehillim every single day, continuing on for 25 years with no interruptions. R Mordechai Friedman was a true Talmud Chacham, finishing Shas before his wedding, and over the years, others noticed his ameilus and began asking him to say Tehillim on their behalf as well. Realizing there was a great need, R Mordechai Friedman opened up the first location of Tehillim Kollel in Monroe, inviting Talmidei Chachimim to join him in completing the entire sefer of Tehilllim each and every day. As Tehillim Kollel became more known and in-demand, he opened another branch in Williamsburg, and then expanded to Eretz Yisroel and Europe. R Mordechas ultimate goal is for every Jewish city to have the same shmirah that was given to that city in the story of the Shlah- a daily recitation of Tehillim.It has been over a decade since its inception and the Tehillim Kollel has served as a lifeline to thousands of Jews worldwide, continuously spreading light to its many subscribers, who witness indescribable yeshuous each day. What started out as a voluntary service of just a few men has now expanded to fifteen established locations throughout the world. Over 100 Talmidei Chachaim worldwide recite the Tehillim each day, 365 days a year without exception, uninterruptedly completing the Sefer Tehillim with great fervor and intensity on behalf of over 2,000 subscribers. Following the recitation of Sefer Tehillim, these men personally mention each subscribers name and request, begging for mercy on their behalf. The atmosphere is always one of kedusha and awe, worthy to be the conduit for so many miracles.Today, Tehillim Kollel is an internationally recognized organization, with an ever expanding member base. This age-old segulah never ceases to inspire, with a steady influx of members sharing their stories of salvation, prominently publicizing the power of Tehillim.Tehillim Kollel operates with the greatest amount of professionalism and confidentiality. Operators are available twenty-four hours a day, accommodating all time zones and off-hour urgent requests. The Gates of Heaven are always open: Tehillim Kollel maintains an open door policy with outstanding compassion and sensitivity. Despite its rapid growth, Tehillim Kollel prides itself in maintaining a personal connection. Driven by a burning passion to help others in need, the founder of Tehillim Kollel continues to seek ways to make these vital services both affordable and accessible to all.",shiezoli,https://www.youtube.com/UCzqpZ8XdZsLBGNYKbEZn-TA,233K subscribers

As a boy he studied at Talmud Torah Chayei Olom in Jerusalem and then at Yeshivas Sfas Emes. Throughout his lifetime he devoted all of his energy to Torah and avodoh, serving Hashem heart and soul. From 5733 (1973) to 5747 (1987) he studied in Crown Heights under meager conditions. During this period he formed a close bond with the Lubavitcher Rebbe ztl, who held him in high regard. In 5747 (1987) he took over the mantle of leadership after his father passed away. The Rebbe&acirc;s mitoh on the steps of the aron kodesh on Motzei Yom Kippur (Photo: Uzi Barak)On the night of Yom Kippur he was able to lead Kol Nidrei, though it had to be delayed for 40 minutes because he was feeling weak. Though he usually leads Maariv as well, this year he asked someone else to take over as chazzan. Immediately following the tefiloh he retired, not setting out negel vasser as he generally does. He recited Krias Shema and settled into bed. A few minutes later, when the gabbai came to connect his oxygen, he saw the Rebbes facial coloration had changed. A medic in the shul at the time arrived and found the Rebbe was suffering from acute shortness of breath and had lost consciousness. He performed pulmonary resuscitation and summoned an intensive care ambulance, but the Rebbe returned his pure soul to his Maker en route to Beilinson Hospital. Shortly before dawn his body (with a loaf of bread placed on it) was returned by a goy to his room alongside the beis medrash where he had davined for years. The bitter news of his passing traveled swiftly around Bnei Brak. A minyon said Tehillim alongside the holy body until Shacharis. Throughout Yom Kippur people arrived in droves to pay their respects, while kohanim had to stay out of the building. The Rebbe is survived by his sons, HaRav Eliyohu Azriel, HaRav Aharon and HaRav Yaakov Yitzchok, as well as his sons-in-law, including the Nadvorner Rebbe in Tzfas.",shiezoli,https://www.youtube.com/UCzqpZ8XdZsLBGNYKbEZn-TA,233K subscribers

Treating unrecognized risk factors like Pre-Diabetes allows reduction of risk and prevention of disease.If you are interested in becoming a patient, please visit our website: https://prevmedheartrisk.com/ABOUT THIS VIDEO:Metformin is the most commonly prescribed oral medication for diabetes. It has side effects, like gastrointestinal distress. Other meds like pioglitazone remain in use by informed providers. Why? Pioglitazone has demonstrated decreased heart attack and stroke events. Pioglitazone gives better outcomes, but also has more serious side effects. It's similar to the ACEI vs ARB question: drugs that decrease cardiovascular inflammation improve outcomes. But they also have more side effects. For a similar story about ACE Inhibitors and ARBS, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGI25sq3bNQFord Brewer is a physician that started as an Emergency Doctor. AFter seeing too many patients coming in dead from early heart attacks, he went to Johns Hopkins to learn Preventive Medicine.

Yo no lo creo. El amor no se acaba de un da para otro, es la suma de esfuerzos inconscientes o consientes que haces para sabotear la relacin lo que terminan con ella.Si esperas que tu matrimonio no termine o por lo menos no termine tan mal, aqu te dejo 10 consejos que desde mi punto de vista deben hacer los dos para mantener una relacin fuerte y duradera si no quieren llegar al divorcio:1. Fidelidad: Si ya s que es obvio, que tu pareja te traicione no est en el plan y si t decides perdonar es tu decisin, solo te digo por tu bien que, si perdonas, perdones de verdad y jams vuelvas a sacar el tema a la luz o vivirs un verdadero infierno.2. Hablen el mismo idioma:  cada ser humano tiene su propio lenguaje del amor y este es tan importante como el idioma en el que nos comunicamos, imagina que tu pareja hablar ruso y tu francs, no podran entenderse, lo mismo pasa cuando uno habla un lenguaje del amor distinto al otro, segn Gary Champman existen 5 lenguajes del amor: a. Palabras de afirmacin. b. Actos de servicio c. Recibir regalos d. Tiempo de Calidad e. Contacto Fsico Te recomiendo que investigues ms de este tema para entender que lenguaje habla cada uno y as puedan entenderse, la clave no est en saberlo, la clave est en que ambos se comprometan a hablar el lenguaje del otro y viceversa.3. Respeto: Cuando uno de los dos le falta al respecto al otro, esto no acaba bien, las grandes rupturas comienzan por grietas que  da a da se hacen ms grandes y muchsimo menos fciles de reparar, comenc este punto hablando del respeto en general a tus ideas, a tus palabras, a tus creencias, pero esta falta de respeto tambin puede darse con parejas pasivo agresivas o con aquellas que te lastiman mental y fsicamente, si esto pasa no hay forma de que quedarse sea una opcin.4. Volver el trabajo o los hijos todo tu mundo: Si te concentras en absoluto en el trabajo o en los hijo y dejas al lado la pareja ya no habr nada que encontrar ah cuando ""tengas tiempo"", las parejas se aburren de que tu nica atencin sea el trabajo o los hijos, comprende que se casaron o unieron para tener una vida en conjunto, no solo para hacer de tu vida la de los dos, cada uno de ustedes tiene aficiones, trabajos e intereses personales, pero tambin tienen que encontrar tiempo de calidad juntos, haciendo cosas que ambos disfruten.5. El silencio: Cuntas palabras cruzas al da con tu pareja que no tengan que ver con el trabajo, los gastos o los nios? An tienen cosas en comn? Es lamentable ver una pareja que no se habla, que no platica de nada, parece que son dos extraos sentados en la misma mesa, esto es un signo de alerta.Si te queda el saco es momento de reflexionar y tomar decisiones, pon en una balanza todas las cosas buenas y malas de la relacin, platica con tu pareja y decidan qu es lo mejor para los dos, quedarse y darse otra oportunidad de comenzar de nuevo o separarse en los mejores trminos posibles, recuerda que el divorcio siempre saca a relucir un lado que jams esperaste ver de la persona que pareca ser el amor de tu vida.Espero encuentres estos consejos de utilidad y te deseo todo el xito del mundo en las decisiones que tomes, si eres feliz con tu pareja vale la pena intentarlo, si la mayora del tiempo y los das eres infeliz, hay cosas que debes pensar y hablar antes de tomar la decisin.Bendiciones hoy y siempre.Recuerda suscribirte, aqu abajo te dejo todas mis redes sociales, ya tambin puedes escucharme en Spotify.Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/cynthiador3/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Cynthia-Dorantes-1647681125364727/Tik Tok: cynthiador3Spotify: Cynthia Dorantes - Desarrollo Profesional y Personalhttps://open.spotify.com/show/4C1PXZ9jCFAoGKYKNj51Dg?si=hxtT60aHSTCUuAtNVSQbhw Todos los Derechos Reservados, Cynthia Dorantes R, 2020.

Scientists have long suspected viral infections could play a role in triggering type 1 diabetes  at least in some people. Now, the New England Journal of Medicine has published the emerging observations of a team of 17 international researchers exploring links between COVID-19 patients and diabetes. Francesco Rubino, a researcher on the project said: ""Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases and we are now realizing the consequences of the inevitable clash between two pandemics.The FreeStyle Libre system significantly improves glycaemic control and hypoglycaemic awareness, according to ABCD's first national audit into the technology.The findings were based on data taken from data more than 10,000 FreeStyle Libre system users from across 102 NHS hospitals in the UK. The authors also found the system reduces diabetes distress and hospital admissions, while also improving HbA1c levels. ABCD who carried out the research said so far there has been ""no comprehensive, real-world, large population-based data sets looking at the impact of FreeStyle Libre on multiple aspects of diabetes care"" The FreeStyle Libre system was made available on the NHS in 2017 to people with type 1 diabetes, who use insulinAn Israeli company claiming to have created a tiny micro-pancreas that can ""cure"" diabetes for millions of people has said it will submit a request next month for human clinical trials in the UK.Betalin Therapeutics said its ""bio-artificial"" pancreas aims to free patients of the need for insulin injections and blood sugar monitoring. It is designed for people with type 1 diabetes, and those with type 2 diabetes who require insulin.The Jerusalem-based firm told the Guardian it would provide a plan for clinical trials to Britain's regulatory agency in August. Betalin aims to begin human testing early next year, with the hope of delivering to the market by 2024.Central to the innovation is a biological scaffold, adapted from pig lung tissue, that holds beta cells. Those cells release insulin based on the patient's blood sugar levels. The miniature artificial pancreas, just visible to the naked eye, is implanted under the skin on the thigh using local anaesthesia. Trials are planned in several hospitals affiliated with the Leeds and Newcastle universities, with Omar Masood, a UK transplant surgeon with experience in combatting diabetes, directing the project.",Jamie Lowe,https://www.youtube.com/UCsjPx1zUmtqcBbZVBr3yiZA,2.79K subscribers

The new technology is the future of lab-grown organs for the replacement of body parts, and its surprisingly advanced.Readily3D, a spin-off of EPFL, developed a new method to print biological tissues using a biological gel that contains the patient's stem cells. A laser is used to harden the gel by polymerization, and the laser beam's position and intensity may be adjusted to harden the portions of gel required to make the appropriate tissue.Impressively enough, the method takes just 30 seconds for living tissue to be printed out on a bioprinter complete with blood vessels and all. This has never been done before and could revolutionize how we produce replacement organs.The printed pancreas secretes a spectrum of critical hormones like insulin, which help regulate blood sugar levels. From now on, diabetes could soon be treated by creating a bio-printed pancreas to exactly match the patient's deficient one.This could eliminate the need to put patients on drugs that often have nefarious side effects and also get rid of animal testing. The solution is a win-win for all. Moreover, the technology could also one day be used to build all kinds of other organs.Find out more information at https://bit.ly/3gYuaRS#engineering",Interesting Engineering,https://www.youtube.com/UCEuiOszNd6msGgqsD0f9YAQ,598K subscribers

Produced mainly in the pituitary gland, growth hormone controls the physical growth of the body. In adults, too much of this hormone causes bones, cartilage, body organs, and other tissues to increase in size. Common changes in appearance include enlarged or swollen nose, ears, hands, and feet.Acromegaly is most often diagnosed in middle-aged adults, but symptoms can appear at any age. In children, too much growth hormone causes a condition called gigantism. Gigantism occurs when excess growth hormone begins before the end of puberty, when childrens growth plates fuse or close. Having too much growth hormone before the growth plates close causes children to grow tall in height.Acromegaly is treatable in most people. But because symptoms come on slowly, health problems can develop before the disorder is diagnosed and treated.Some people with acromegaly may have a genetic condition that can lead tumors to develop in different parts of their bodies. Increased growth hormone can cause these other tumors to grow.Untreated, acromegaly can lead to serious health problems and early death. But when successfully treated, symptoms generally improve and may go away altogether. Life expectancy may return to normal. Symptoms of acromegaly can vary from person to person. Common changes in physical appearance include- Hands and feet become larger and swollen- Lips, nose, and tongue become larger- Bone changes: brow and lower jaw jut out, bridge of the nose gets bigger, and space between teeth increases- Skin becomes thick, coarse, and oily- Sweating and skin odor increase- Voice becomes deeper",CheckRare,https://www.youtube.com/UCp29uhFxrPqHJ8tbDefgr-g,3.08K subscribers

Rarely, it is caused by tumors of the pancreas, lungs, and other parts of the brain stimulating the pituitary gland to produce growth hormone. It is sporadic in 95% of the cases, but almost 50% of the childhood-onset cases have an identifiable gene mutation, most commonly in the AIP gene or GPR101 gene. Treatment may include hormones, radiotherapy, and surgery. When left untreated, it can result in serious illness and premature death.

Growth hormone releasing hormone then acts directly on somatotrophs of the anterior pituitary to induce transcription of the growth hormone gene and, thereby, to stimulate both synthesis and secretion of growth hormone.The main cause of acromegaly is a pituitary adenoma which is a tumor of somatotroph cells in the anterior pituitary gland. These somatotroph cells continuously make excess growth hormone.More rarely, acromegaly can result from hypothalamic tumors that release too much growth hormone releasing hormone or even tumors from other parts of the body that startproducing growth hormone ectopically - meaning that it comes from an unexpected location.When the pituitary gland releases growth hormone into your bloodstream, it triggers your liver to produce a hormone called insulin-like growth factor 1. IGF 1 is what causes your bones and other tissues to grow. Too much growth hormone leads to too much IGF 1, which can cause acromegaly signs, symptoms and complications.The symptoms of acromegaly, which can take years before they are recognized, include growth of the bones of the hands, feet, and lower jaw and protrusion of the forehead; soft tissue swelling in hands, feets, face, and tongue; increased size of organs; and excessive sweating.The diagnosis of acromegaly can be made when there are elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 and growthhormone.An MRI can help confirm the presence of the pituitary tumor. Treatment of acromegaly depends on the underlying cause.If theres a pituitary adenoma, then surgery can be done to try to remove the growth, and in cases where that doesnt work, radiation therapy can be used.Medications like somatostatin analogs can also be used to limit growth hormone production.Alternatively, growth hormone receptor antagonists can be used to stop growth hormone from binding to target tissues.",1 Post Medicine,https://www.youtube.com/UCuvrSonNTkdaxLBh8Qz0d2g,23.2K subscribers

Too much GH or IGF-1 in the bloodstream signals the body to grow, and can result in a wide range of signs and symptoms. People living with acromegaly can experience the following signs and symptoms:- Enlargement of the hands, feet, tongue and internal organs- Increased sweating- Thickening of the facial features, especially the nose- More prominent jaw and forehead- Spreading out of the teeth- Joint pain- Sleep apnea- Fatigue- Pain and tingling in the hands and wrists- Large numbers of skin tags- Increased incidence of colon polyps",CheckRare,https://www.youtube.com/UCp29uhFxrPqHJ8tbDefgr-g,3.08K subscribers

As well as many complications of the internal organs and muscles. It usually begins between the ages of 30 and 50. It occurs when the pituitary gland overproduces growth hormone (GH). The overproduction of GH is a result of a benign tumor on the pituitary gland. However, it can be caused by tumors in other areas of the body. GH travels via the blood to the liver and produces the growth hormone: IGF-I. Other types of GH causes the release of more growth hormones. Both result in the overgrowth of bone and soft tissues.What are the Symptoms of Acromegaly? Limb weakness, abnormally large feet & hands, headaches, and vision problems. As well as hypertension, protruding jaw, barrel chest, skin tags, and fatigue.How is Acromegaly Treated? First there's a physical exam, GH test, and a growth hormone suppression test. Each test is used to confirm Acromegaly. Surgery to remove a pituitary gland tumor is performed through the nose. Which is an endoscopic surgical method.What are some other treatments? Since tumors are usually found in late-stage, removal is not usually successful. It usually takes a combination of other treatments, such as: Hormone blocking medication and radiation treatments. Radiation is used to suppress and destroy remaining tumor cells. When left untreated, life expectancy can be greatly reduced. No known prevention exists for Acromegaly. However, early treatment can reduce the severity of symptoms. Early treatment can potentially avoid life-threatening complications.Website: https://healthery.com/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/healtheryTwitter: https://twitter.com/MyHealthery",healthery,https://www.youtube.com/UCLIM5ky9cpuKAe3VaKTqQTw,33.8K subscribers

Acromegaly is a rare endocrine disorder usually caused by a benign pituitary tumor and is characterized by excess production of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 hormone. The approval of octreotide was largely based on the pivotal phase 3 CHIASMA OPTIMAL clinical trial showing Mycapssa to be superior to placebo in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, nine-month study. The most common adverse events observed with Mycapssa were: cholelithiasis and complications of cholelithiasis; hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia; thyroid function abnormalities; cardiac function abnormalities; and decreased vitamin B12 levels and abnormal Schillings tests.To learn more about this and other endocrine disorders, visit checkrare.com/diseases/endocrine-disorders/",CheckRare,https://www.youtube.com/UCp29uhFxrPqHJ8tbDefgr-g,3.08K subscribers

It is defined as excess terminal hair growth in androgen dependent areas. Hirsutism must be distinguished from hypertrichosis, which is excessive hair growth in non-androgen dependent areas and is not caused by excess androgen. Hypertrichosis is much less common and can be seen with certain genetic conditions, drugs, malnutrition, hypothyroidism, and other diseases, such as porphyria.Polycystic ovarian syndrome accounts for 3/4 of Hirsutism cases. It can be diagnosed based on 2 or more of the key features:  One, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism  Two, abnormal menstruation, and  Three, the presence of ovarian cysts.But to diagnose PCOS a number of other conditions must be excludedFirst, and foremost pregnancy must be excluded in woman with irregular or absent menses.Adrenal or ovarian tumours may be the cause, if there is signs of viritilization, these include, a rapid increase in hair growth, deepening of the voice, increased muscle mass, male pattern balding, or genital ambiguity. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, is caused by a deficiency in a key enzyme in the adrenal steroid pathway, this can lead to hirsutism. Androgenic medications and endocrinopathies such as Cushings syndrome, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, and hyperprolactinemia are other causes to consider. Up to 15% of cases of hirsitism are idiopathic.The main goal of therapy is to treat the underlying cause. In PCOS, weight loss can help to reverse the underlying pathology.All causes of Hirsutism respond to cosmetic procedures such as shaving, plucking, and waxing, but these do not affect the hair follicle and hence do not prevent regrowth. Folliculytic therapy such as electrolysis can reduce hair follicle numbers but can be costly and time consuming. Eflornithine cream is effective for hair in a limited distribution. Hormonal therapy and antiandrogen therapy can help to reestablish the balance of estrogen to androgen, this reduces current hair and preventing further growth.",Medskl.com,https://www.youtube.com/UC54htze_JB0zz9H6oAbMOJQ,73.5K subscribers

Retinal arterioles narrow and may become completely occluded. These changes lead to hypoxia in ischaemic areas of the retina. Chronic retinal hypoxia results in the release of growth factors including a factor which stimulates the rapid generation of new blood vessels. More blood vessels could carry more blood to the area and so counter the hypoxia. However there is a problem. In the retina the excessive growth of new small blood vessels is called proliferate retinopathy. These new vessels have fragile walls which can rupture and bleed; this will cause retinal haemorrhages which cause progressive damage to the light sensitive cells. Regular retinal examination and possible photocoagulation can cauterise new vessels before they have time to haemorrhage, this can prevent or delay the development of blindness. Poor glycaemic control, with hyperglycaemia is a definite risk factor for diabetic retinopathy. From this it is clear that good levels of glycaemic control reduce the probability of this complication developing. Hypertension is another risk factor for diabetic retinopathy which should therefore be managed. Diabetics are also more prone to cataracts (opacity of the lens) and glaucoma (increased pressure within the eyeball).",Dr. John Campbell,https://www.youtube.com/UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg,2.31 million subscribers

Glucose is a type of sugar that your body requires and uses for energy. Your body converts the carbohydrates you eat into glucose.Having too much glucose in your body can be a sign of a health problem. If you dont receive treatment and your glucose levels remain high, you can develop serious complications.The urine glucose test involves taking a sample of urine. Once you provide your sample, a small cardboard device known as a dipstick will measure your glucose levels.The dipstick will change color depending on the amount of glucose in your urine. If you have a moderate or high amount of glucose in your urine, your doctor will perform further testing to determine the underlying cause.The most common cause of elevated glucose levels is diabetes, a condition that affects your bodys ability to manage glucose levels. Its important to monitor your glucose levels if you have already been diagnosed with diabetes, or if you show symptoms of prediabetes.These symptoms include:excessive thirstblurred visionfatigueWhen left untreated, diabetes can lead to long-term complications, including kidney failure and nerve damage.1 How is glucose tested in urine?2 What does it mean if you have glucose in your urine?3 Does glucose in urine always mean diabetes?4 What does sugar in the urine mean?5 Is it bad to have sugar in your urine?6 How can I reduce sugar in my urine?#urineglucosetestinurduhindi#urinesugar#diabetestestinurine#3+urinesugar",EASY LAB BY N K LABORATORIES,https://www.youtube.com/UCh93T1eKH7Yq8rKx7KT28yA,7.43K subscribers

The pancreas, therefore, produces little or no insulin. Only about 5 to 10% of all people with diabetes have type 1 disease. Most people who have type 1 diabetes develop the disease before age 30, although it can develop later in life.Type 2 Diabetes MellitusIn type 2 diabetes (formerly called non insulin-dependent diabetes or adult-onset diabetes), the pancreas often continues to produce insulin, sometimes even at higher-than-normal levels, especially early in the disease. However, the body develops resistance to the effects of insulin, so there is not enough insulin to meet the bodys needs. As type 2 diabetes progresses, the insulin-producing ability of the pancreas decreases.Complications of diabetes(1) Brain, causing a stroke(2) Eyes (diabetic retinopathy), causing blindness(3) Heart, causing a heart attack(4) Kidneys (diabetic nephropathy), causing chronic kidney disease(5) Nerves (diabetic neuropathy), causing a decreased sensation in feetBenedicts solution is a deep-blue alkaline chemical reagent used to test for the presence of the aldehyde functional group -CHO which consists of copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4. 5H2O), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), sodium citrate (Na3C6H5O7) and distilled water. Sodium carbonate renders alkaline conditions which are required for the redox reaction, while sodium citrate is a complexing agent which complexes with the copper (II) ions to avoid degradation into copper (I) ions during storage.Principle of Benedicts testBenedicts test is performed by heating the reducing sugar solution with Benedicts reagent. The presence of the alkaline sodium carbonate converts the sugar into a strong reducing agent called enediols.  During the reaction, enediols decrease the cupric particles (Cu2+)  present in Benedicts reagent to cuprous particles (Cu+) which appear as red copper oxide (Cu2O) which is insoluble in water. When Benedicts reagent solution and reducing sugars are heated together, the solution changes its color to orange-red/ brick red precipitate. The red-colored cuprous oxide is insoluble in water and hence, separate out from the solution. When the concentration of the reducing sugar is high in the solution, then the color becomes more intense (reddish) and the volume of the precipitate increases in the test tube making it clearly visible.The procedure of Benedicts Test1. Pipette out 2 ml (10 drops) of Benedicts reagent and placed it in the clean test tube2. Approximately 1 ml of sample (urine) is added to Benedicts reagent.3. The test tube is placed over the boiling water bath for 3-5 minutes (can be heated directly over flame).4. Observe for color change in the solution of test tubes or precipitate formation.Result Interpretation of Benedicts Test1. If the color upon boiling is changed into green, then there would be 0.1 to 0.5 percent sugar in solution.2. If it changes color to yellow, then 0.5 to 1 percent sugar is present.3. If it changes to orange, then it means that 1 to 1.5 percent sugar is present.4. If color changes to red,then 1.5 to 2.0 percent sugar is present.5. And if color changes to brick red,it means that more than 2 percent sugar is present in solution.Get in touch with the solution by just clicking the following links- Facebook Group- https://www.facebook.com/groups/solutionpharamcyFacebook Page- https://www.facebook.com/pharmavideo/New Channel (Pharmacy Dictionary) https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt6OXVV_2oxf5DD0Mad6e9AInstagram- https://www.instagram.com/solutionpharmacy/E-Mail for official and other work - solutionpharmacy@gmail.comLinkedIn- http://linkedin.com/in/pushpendrakpatel#solutionpharmacy #Pharmacologyclass #Pharmacognosyvideos #GPATonlinetest #GPATclass #GPATvideos #Microbiologyclass#Microbiology#",Solution- Pharmacy,https://www.youtube.com/UCnXt2toLLxXDDHGj2OR5_8A,674K subscribers

Abnormally high amounts of sugar in the urine, known as glycosuria, are usually the result of high blood sugar levels. High blood sugar usually occurs in diabetes, especially when untreated. When the blood sugar is high, there is too much sugar in the fluid leaving the kidney to be reabsorbed, so some sugar passes into the urine.Sugar in the urine can be detected in the laboratory or is easy to detect at home with a urine dipstick test.This video explains how to detect the presence of sugar in the given sample of urine.",0,0,0

Funded by MeitY (Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology)Detection of Sugar in Urine :-Glucose is a type of sugar that our body requires and uses for energy. Body converts the carbohydrates we eat into glucose. Having too much glucose in the body can be a sign of a health problem.  Ordinarily, glucose (sugar) is absent in normal urine. But when the glucose level in blood exceeds the renal threshold of glucose (160  180 mg /dl), glucose starts to appear in urine.
